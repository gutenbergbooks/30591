Transcriber&rsquo;s Note:<br /><br />

    In this work, all spellings and punctuation were
    reproduced from the original work except in the very few
    cases where an obvious typo occurred. These typos are
    corrected without comment. <br /><br />

    In the original volumes in this set, each even-numbered
    page had a header consisting of the page number, the
    volume title, and the chapter number. The odd-numbered
    page header consisted of the year of the diary entry, a
    subject phrase, and the page number. In this set of
    e-books, the year is included as part of the date (which
    in the original volume were in the form reproduced here,
    minus the year). The subject phrase has been converted to
    sidenotes located below the relevant page number. <br /><br />

    In the original book set, consisting of three volumes,
    the master index was in Volume 3. In this set of e-books,
    the index has been duplicated into each of the other
    volumes.  Navigation links were created to the entries for the
    current volume.

Sefton, who took the whole party in his omnibus, and his
great open carriage; Talleyrand, Madame de Dino, Standish,
Neumann, and the Molyneux family; dined in a room called
&lsquo;the Apollo&rsquo; at the Crown and Sceptre. I thought we should
never get Talleyrand up two narrow perpendicular staircases,
but he sidles and wriggles himself somehow into every place
he pleases. A capital dinner, tolerably pleasant, and a divine
evening. Went afterwards to the &lsquo;Travellers,&rsquo; and played at
whist, and read the new edition of &lsquo;Horace Walpole&rsquo;s Letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to Sir Horace Mann.&rsquo; There is something I don&rsquo;t like in his
style; his letters don&rsquo;t amuse me so much as they ought to do.</p>

<p>A letter this morning from Sir Henry Lushington about
Monk Lewis. He is rather averse to a biographical sketch,
because he thinks a true account of his life and character
would not do him credit, and adds a sketch of the latter,
which is not flattering. Lord Melbourne told me the other
day a queer trait of Lewis. He had a long-standing quarrel
with Lushington. Having occasion to go to Naples, he wrote
beforehand to him, to say that their quarrel had better be
<i>suspended</i>, and he went and lived with him and his sister
(Lady L.) in perfect cordiality during his stay. When he
departed he wrote to Lushington to say that now they should
resume their quarrel, and put matters in the &lsquo;status quo ante
pacem,&rsquo; and accordingly he did resume it, with rather more
<i>acharnement</i> than before.</p>

<p>Charles Wood came into my room yesterday, and talked
of the King&rsquo;s letter, said he understood the Archbishop had
imparted it to the seven Bishops who had voted, that nothing
would come of it, for it was a private letter which nobody
had a right to take up. I see the Government are not displeased
at such an evidence of the King&rsquo;s goodwill. The
King and Taylor both love letter-writing, and both are voluminously
inclined. Wood told me that last year Lord Grey
got one letter from them (for Taylor writes and the King
approves) of seven sheets; what a mass of silly verbiage
there must have been to wade
through.<a name="FNA_21_01" id="FNA_21_01"></a><a href="#FN_21_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

and Earl Grey proves that the King&rsquo;s letters were written by Sir Herbert
Taylor with the greatest ability.]</p></div>

<h3>July 3rd, 1833</h3>

<p>Nothing to put down these last two days, unless
I go back to my old practice of recording what I read,
and which I rather think I left off because I read nothing,
and had nothing to put down; but in the last two days I
have read a little of Cicero&rsquo;s &lsquo;Second Philippic,&rsquo; Voltaire&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Siècle de Louis XIV.,&rsquo; Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Journey to the West
Indies;&rsquo; bought some books, went to the opera to hear Bellini&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Norma,&rsquo; and thought it heavy, Pasta&rsquo;s voice not what it was.

<span class="pagehead">SALUTES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY.</span>
Everybody talking yesterday of Althorp&rsquo;s exhibition in the
House of Commons the night before (for particulars of which
see newspapers and Parliamentary debates). It is too ludicrous,
too melancholy, to think of the finances of this country
being <i>managed</i> by such a man: what will not people endure?
What a strange medley politics produce: a wretched clerk
in an office who makes some unimportant blunder, some
clerical error, or who exhibits signs of incapacity for work,
which it does not much signify whether it be well or ill done,
is got rid of, and here this man, this good-natured, popular,
liked-and-laughed-at good fellow, more of a grazier than a
statesman, blurts out his utter ignorance before a Reformed
Parliament, and people lift up their eyes, shrug their
shoulders, and laugh and chuckle, but still on he goes.</p>

<h3>July 4th, 1833</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday, and Council for a foolish
business. The King has been (not unnaturally) disgusted
at the Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s progresses with her daughter
through the kingdom, and amongst the rest with her sailings
at the Isle of Wight, and the continual popping in the shape
of salutes to Her Royal Highness. He did not choose that
this latter practice should go on, and he signified his pleasure
to Sir James Graham and Lord Hill, for salutes are matter
of general order, both to army and navy. They (and Lord
Grey) thought it better to make no order on the subject, and
they opened a negotiation with the Duchess of Kent, to induce
her of her own accord to waive the salutes, and when
she went to the Isle of Wight to send word that as she was
sailing about for her amusement she had rather they did not
salute her whenever she appeared. The negotiation failed,
for the Duchess insisted upon her right to be saluted, and
would not give it up. Kemp told me he had heard that
Conroy (who is a ridiculous fellow, a compound of &lsquo;Great
Hussy&rsquo; and the Chamberlain of the Princess of
Navarre<a name="FNA_21_02" id="FNA_21_02"></a><a href="#FN_21_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>)
had said, &lsquo;that as Her Royal Highness&rsquo;s <i>confidential adviser</i>,
he could not recommend her to give way on this point.&rsquo; As
she declined to accede to the proposals, nothing remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
but to alter the regulations, and accordingly yesterday, by an
Order in Council, the King changed them, and from this
time the Royal Standard is only to be saluted when the King
or the Queen is on board.</p>

<h3>Friday, July 12th, 1833</h3>

<p>Went to Newmarket on Sunday, came
back yesterday, got back at half-past nine, went to Crockford&rsquo;s,
and heard on the steps of the house that poor Dover had
died that morning. The accounts I had received at Newmarket
confirmed my previous impression that there was no
hope; and, indeed, the sanguine expectations of his family
are only to be accounted for by that disposition in the human
mind to look at the most favourable side, and to cling with
pertinacity to hope when reason bids us despair. There
has seldom been destroyed a fairer scene of happiness and
domestic prosperity than by this event. He dies in the
flower of his age, surrounded with all the elements of happiness,
and with no drawback but that of weak health, which
until within the last few months was not sufficiently important
to counterbalance the good, and only amounted to feebleness
and delicacy of constitution; and it is the breaking up of
a house replete with social enjoyment, six or seven children
deprived of their father, and a young wife and his old father
overwhelmed with a grief which the former may, but the
latter never can get over, for to him time sufficient cannot in
the course of nature be allotted. Few men could be more generally
regretted than Lord Dover will be by an immense circle
of connections and friends for his really amiable and endearing
qualities, by the world at large for the serious loss which
society sustains, and the disappointment of the expectations
of what he one day might have been. He occupied as large
a space in society as his talents (which were by no means
first-rate) permitted; but he was clever, lively, agreeable,
good-tempered, good-natured, hospitable, liberal and rich, a
zealous friend, an eager political partisan, full of activity and
vivacity, enjoying life, and anxious that the circle of his enjoyment
should be widely extended. George Agar Ellis was
the only son of Lord Clifden, and obtained early the reputation
of being a prodigy of youthful talent and information.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF LORD DOVER.</span>
He was quick, lively, and had a very retentive memory, and
having entered the world with this reputation, and his great
expectations besides, he speedily became one of the most
conspicuous youths of the day. Having imbibed a great
admiration for Lord Orford (Horace Walpole), he evinced a
disposition to make him his model, and took pains to store
his mind with that sort of light miscellaneous literature in
which Lord Orford delighted. He got into the House of
Commons, but never was able to speak, never attempted to
say more than a few words, and from the beginning gave up
all idea of oratorical distinction. After running about the
world for a few years he resolved to marry, and as his heart
had nothing to do with this determination, he pitched upon
a daughter of the Duke of Beaufort&rsquo;s, who he thought would
suit his purpose, and confer upon him a very agreeable family
connection. Being on a tour in the North, he intended to
finish it at Badminton, and there to propose to Lady
Georgiana Somerset, with full assurance that he should not
be rejected; but having stopped for a few days at Lord
Carlisle&rsquo;s at Castle Howard, he there found a girl who spared
him the trouble of going any further, and at the expiration
of three or four days he proposed in form to Lord Morpeth&rsquo;s
second daughter, Georgiana Howard, who, not less surprised
than pleased and proud at the conquest she found she had
so unconsciously made, immediately accepted him. There
never was a less romantic attachment, or more business-like
engagement, nor was there ever a more fortunate choice or
a happier union. Mild, gentle, and amiable, full of devotion
to, and admiration of her husband, her soft and feminine
qualities were harmoniously blended with his vivacity and
animal spirits, and produced together results not more felicitous
for themselves than agreeable to all who belonged to
their society. Soon after his marriage, Ellis, who had never
been vicious or profligate, but who was free from anything
like severity or austerity, began to show symptoms of a devout
propensity, and not contented with an ordinary discharge
of religious duties, he read tracts and sermons, frequented
churches and preachings, gave up driving on Sundays, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
appeared in considerable danger of falling into the gulf of
methodism; but this turn did not last long, and whatever
induced him to take it up, he apparently became bored with
his self-imposed restrictions, and after a little while he threw
off his short-lived sanctity, and resumed his worldly habits
and irreverent language, for he was always a loose talker.
Active and ambitious in his pursuits, and magnificent in his
tastes, he devoted himself to literature, politics, and society;
to the two first with greater success than would be expected
of a man whose talents for composition were below mediocrity,
and for public speaking none at all. He became the
patron of various literary institutions and undertakings connected
with the arts, he took the chair at public meetings
for literary or scientific purposes, he read a good deal and
wrote a little. The only work which he put forth of any
consequence was &lsquo;The Life of Frederick II.,&rsquo; which contained
scarcely any original matter, and was remarkably barren of
original ideas; but as it was a compilation from several very
amusing writers, was not devoid of
entertainment.<a name="FNA_21_03" id="FNA_21_03"></a><a href="#FN_21_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Though
unable to speak in Parliament, he entered warmly into
politics, formed several political intimacies, especially with
the Chancellor (Brougham), and undertook much of the
minor Government work of keeping proxies, making houses
(in the House of Lords), and managing the local details of
the House itself. But however contracted his sphere both
in literature and politics, in society his merits were conspicuous
and his success unquestionable. Without a strong
understanding, destitute of fancy and imagination, and with
neither eloquence nor wit, he was a remarkably agreeable
man. He was hospitable, courteous, and cordial; he collected
about him the most distinguished persons in every
rank and condition of life. He had a constant flow of animal
spirits, much miscellaneous information, an excellent memory,
a great enjoyment of fun and humour, a refined taste and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE LOCAL COURTS BILL DEFEATED.</span>
perfect good breeding. But his more solid merit was the
thorough goodness of his heart, and the strong and durable
nature of his friendships and early attachments. To the
friends of his youth he was bound to the last moment of his
life with unremitting kindness and never-cooling affection;
no greater connections or more ambitious interests cancelled
those early ties, and though he was not unnaturally dazzled
and flattered by the later intimacies he contracted, this never
for a moment made him forgetful of or indifferent to his first
and less distinguished friends.</p>

[Lord Dover&rsquo;s volume on the &lsquo;Man in the Iron Mask&rsquo; deserves not to
be altogether forgotten, though more recent researches have proved that
his theory identifying the &lsquo;Iron Mask&rsquo; with Mathioli, the captured agent of
the Duke of Parma, cannot be supported.]</p></div>

<p>The Local Courts Bill was thrown out by twelve. His
party made the <i>amende honorable</i> to Lyndhurst, and went
down in a body to back him. He and Brougham each spoke
for two hours or more, and both with consummate skill, the
latter especially in his very best style, and with extraordinary
power and eloquence. It would not perhaps be easy to decide
which made the ablest speech; that of Lyndhurst was clear,
logical, and profound, replete with a sort of judicial weight
and dignity, with a fine and cutting vein of sarcasm constantly
peeping from behind a thick veil of complimentary
phraseology. Brougham more various, more imaginative,
more impassioned, more eloquent, and exceedingly dexterous.
Unable to crush Lyndhurst, he resembled one of Homer&rsquo;s
heroes, who, missing his great antagonist, wreaked his fury
on some ignominious foe, and he fell upon Wynford with
overpowering severity. As somebody told me who heard
him, &lsquo;He flayed him alive, and kept rubbing salt upon his
back.&rsquo; It appears to have been a great exhibition. There
was Lyndhurst after his speech, drinking tea, not a bit tired,
elated and chuckling: &lsquo;Well, how long will the Chancellor
speak, do you think, eh? we shall have some good fun from
him. What lies he will tell, and how he will misrepresent
everything! come, let&rsquo;s have done our tea, that we mayn&rsquo;t
miss him, eh?&rsquo; The truth seems to be that the Bill is not a
good Bill, and is condemned by the lawyers, that some such
measure is required, but that this is nothing more than a
gigantic job, conferring enormous patronage upon the Chancellor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The debate, however, appears to have afforded a
grand display of
talent.<a name="FNA_21_04" id="FNA_21_04"></a><a href="#FN_21_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

[The successful efforts of the Tories to prevent the establishment of a
system of Local Courts of limited jurisdiction, retarded for many years that
important measure to which we, at last, owe the County Courts&mdash;now an
institution of the utmost social utility. Nothing can be more characteristic
of the blind bigotry of the Tory party at that time, and the party spirit of
Lord Lyndhurst; for the measure had no bearing upon politics, and was
simply a cheap and easy mode of recovering small debts.]</p></div>

<p>Macaulay is said to have made an admirable speech last
night on the Indian question in the House of Commons. I
observe, by the bye, that very few of the Bishops voted the
other night, but all who did voted with Government; even
Exeter went away before the division, so the King&rsquo;s letter
seems to have produced some effect. I have had a squabble
with Lady Holland about some nonsense, but she was insolent,
so I was fierce, and then she was civil, as she usually is
to those who won&rsquo;t be bullied by her.</p>

<h3>July 12th, 1833</h3>

<p>It is extraordinary how little sensation the
defeat of Government in the House of Lords has caused.
Everybody talks of the debate, nobody thinks of the event,
but I find several people expect that the Church Bill will be
thrown out, which would be a much more serious thing. I
betted Stanley five pounds to one yesterday that they were
not beaten on the second reading of the Irish Church Bill. I
have concluded a bargain with Murray for Lewis&rsquo;s journal
and sold it him for 400 guineas, the MSS. to be returned to
Lushington, and fifteen copies for him, and five for me,
gratis.</p>

<h3>July 14th, 1833</h3>

<p>Wharncliffe told me yesterday that the Duke
and the Opposition do not mean to throw out the Irish Church
Bill on the second reading. He had been in great alarm
himself after the Duke&rsquo;s speech lest they should, but had
since heard what satisfied him they would not; he said that
Sir John Wrottesley&rsquo;s motion for a call of the House had given
them great offence, and was an extreme piece of folly, for it
was obviously for the purpose of bullying the House of
Lords, who would not be bullied, and this species of menace
only increased the obstinacy of the majority there, but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRISH CHURCH BILL.</span>
the Duke could command the greater number, and though
there might be a division (as some cannot be restrained
from dividing) there would be no endeavour to throw
it out. Thus it is that one folly produces another: the
Duke&rsquo;s silly speech about the Coronation Oath (a piece of
nonsense quite unworthy of his straightforward, manly sense)
produced Wrottesley&rsquo;s bravado in the other House. But
Wharncliffe says he is persuaded nothing can prevent a collision
between the two Houses ultimately. There is a great
idea that the Government will fall to pieces before the end
of this year. Tavistock told me that Althorp would certainly
go out in a very few months, and <i>that he would go on the turf</i>!
Tom Duncombe is found guilty at Hertford (of a libel),
and recommended to mercy, to the infinite diversion of his
friends.</p>

<h3>July 15th, 1833</h3>

<p>Yesterday came the news of Captain Napier
having captured the whole of Don Miguel&rsquo;s fleet, to the great
delight of the Whigs, and equal mortification of the Tories.
It appears to have been a dashing affair, and very cowardly
on the part of the Miguelites. The day before the news
came, Napier had been struck out of the British Navy.</p>

<p>Met Duncannon in the morning, who was very gloomy
about Wednesday, at the same time saying he rather hoped
the Tories would throw out the Irish Church Bill, for it was
impossible to go on as they were now doing; that if they did,
two motions would infallibly be made in the House of Commons,
an address to the Crown to make Peers, and a vote for
the expulsion of the Bishops, and that both would be carried by
great majorities. He talked much of the Irish Church, and
of the abominations that had been going on even under his
own eyes. One case he mentions of a man who holds a
living of 1,000&#8467;. a year close to Bessborough, whom he
knows. There is no house, no church, and there are no
Protestants in the parish. He went there to be inducted,
and dined with Duncannon at Bessborough the day after.
Duncannon asked him how he had managed the necessary
form, and he said he had been obliged to borrow the clerk
and three Protestants from a neighbouring parish, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
read the morning and evening service to them within the
ruined walls of the old Abbey, and they signed a certificate
that he had complied with the forms prescribed by law; he
added that people would no longer endure such things, that
no existing interests were to be touched, and that if remedial
measures were still opposed, the whole fabric would be pulled
down. He was still persuaded that the Opposition meant
to throw out the Bill.</p>

<p>In the evening I dined at the Duke of Richmond&rsquo;s, and
found Stanley informed of the result of the meeting at the
Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s in the morning, which was decisive
on the question. The Duke, after his extraordinary speech
in the House of Lords, when he mounted the old broken-down
hobby of the Coronation Oath and cut a curvet
that alarmed his friends and his enemies, assembled the
Tories at Apsley House, and there, resuming his own good
sense, though not very consistently, made them a speech,
and told them that some such measure must be passed, for
nothing else could save the Irish Church: that there were
things in this Bill that he did not approve of at all, but he
could not resist its going into committee, and he finished
by announcing that he should either vote for it or not vote
at all, according to circumstances. Lyndhurst goes on the
circuit on Wednesday, so that though there will be a division
there will be a large majority for the Bill, which is the best
thing that could happen. Stanley said there would be a
great speech from Lord Grey, talked of his power in that line,
thought his reply at five in the morning on the Catholic question
the most perfect speech that ever was made. He would
rather have made it than four of Brougham&rsquo;s. He gave the
following instance of Lord Grey&rsquo;s readiness and clear-headed
accuracy. In one of the debates on the West India question,
he went to Stanley, who was standing under the gallery, and
asked him on what calculation he had allotted the sum of
twenty millions. Stanley explained to him a complicated
series of figures, of terms of years, interest, compound interest,
value of labour, etc., after which Lord Grey went back
to his place, rose, and went through the whole with as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND THE BONAPARTES.</span>
clearness and precision as if all these details had been all along
familiar to his mind. It is very extraordinary that he should
unite so much oratorical and Parliamentary power with such
weakness of character. He is a long way from a great man
altogether.</p>

<p>I met the Duke in the evening at the Duchess of Cannizzaro&rsquo;s,
talked of Napier&rsquo;s affair, at which he was extremely
amused, though he thinks it a very bad thing, and not the
least bad part of it that Napier should be lost to the service,
so distinguished as he is. It was he who in 1803 (I believe)
was the cause of the capture of a French squadron by Sir
Alexander Cochrane. The English fell in with and cleared
the French fleet, but Napier in a sloop outsailed the rest, and
firing upon the stern of the French Admiral&rsquo;s flagship,
so damaged her (contriving by skilful evolutions to avoid
being hurt himself) that the rest of the ships were obliged
to haul to, to save the Admiral&rsquo;s ship, which gave time to the
British squadron to come up, when they took four out of the
five sail. The Whigs all talk of this action as decisive of
the Portuguese contest; the Duke says it is impossible to say
what the moral effect may be, but in a military point of view
it will not have much influence upon it. Lucien Bonaparte
was there, and was introduced to the Duke. He laughed and
said, &lsquo;He shook hands with me, and we were as intimate as
if we had known each other all our lives!&rsquo; He said he had
likewise called on Joseph, who had called on him, but they
had never met: he added that some civilities had passed
between them in Spain. Before the battle of Salamanca he
had regularly intercepted the French correspondence, and as
one of the King&rsquo;s daughters was ill at Paris, and daily intelligence
came of her health, he always sent it to him. He did
not forward the letters, because they contained other matters,
but he sent a flag every day to the outposts, who said, &lsquo;Allez
dire au Roi que sa fille se porte mieux,&rsquo; or as it might be.
There was Lucien running downstairs to look for his carriage,
one brother of Napoleon who refused to be a king, and
another who was King of Naples, and afterwards King of
Spain, both living as private gentlemen in England!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
The Cabinet met at the instance of Lord John
Russell to take into consideration Lord Hill&rsquo;s <i>not voting</i> on
Brougham&rsquo;s Local Courts Bill. Nothing came of it, and it
is extremely absurd when their own people continually vote
as they please&mdash;Duncannon, Ellice, Charles Grey, etc. On
Sunday I went to hear Mr. Blount preach. He is very
popular, and has a great deal of merit, not so clever as
Thorpe, not so eloquent as Anderson, but with a great
appearance of zeal and sincerity, and he is very conscientious
and disinterested, for he refused the living of Chelsea (which
Lord Cadogan offered him) because he thought he could not
discharge the duties belonging to it together with those of
his present cure. Went last night to hear Malibran in the
&lsquo;Sonnambula,&rsquo; a fine piece of acting and fine singing.</p>

<h3>July 18th, 1833</h3>

<p>I fell in with Sir Robert Peel yesterday in
the Park, and rode with him for an hour or two, never
having had so much conversation with him before in my life.
He was very agreeable, told me that he had just come from
the Police Committee, when a member of one of the political
unions had been under examination, who had acknowledged
that they were provided with arms, and exercised themselves
in their use, to be ready for the struggle which they thought
was fast approaching. This evidence will appear in the
Report to the House of Commons, but what will not appear
is that an attempt was made (by Mr. Charles Buller especially)
to prevent its being elicited, and the aforesaid gentleman
endeavoured to put down Peel, who drew it out. The
room was cleared, and they had an angry discussion, but
Peel insisted upon asking his question, and carried his
point, even in this Radical Committee. It seems to have
been very curious, and the man was nothing loth to say all
he knew. Peel thinks very ill of everything. I asked him
if there was no way of putting down the Repeal Union. He
said none, and that they had found the impossibility of doing
so in Ireland, except by investing the Lord Lieutenant with
extraordinary powers; talked of the Government and its
strange way of going on, spoke highly of Stanley in all ways.</p>

<p>Althorp&rsquo;s retirement seems certain, and if the Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STANLEY AND ALTHORP.</span>
goes on Stanley will be leader, but unless he puts it all
on a different footing it must break up, and unless the Government
people can be brought under better discipline it will
fall to pieces, for nobody will support it on that motion of
Wrottesley&rsquo;s for a call of the House. Both Stanley and
Althorp deprecated it in the strongest way, in the name of
their colleagues as well as their own, with whom Stanley
said they had consulted, and that they felt it would materially
embarrass the Government if persisted in, and after
this Duncannon, Kennedy, and Charles Grey voted for the
call, Ellice and Poulett Thomson stayed away. The other
night (I forget on what question) Ellice voted one way and
Stanley the other, and the former said to the latter as he was
going out of the house, &lsquo;You will see if the boys don&rsquo;t go with
me instead of with you.&rsquo; The vote of the night before last
against sinecures was carried in a thin house, only one
Cabinet Minister present (Althorp), no pains taken to secure
a majority, and he (Althorp) saying that it signified more to
the Tories than to him, and they ought to have come down
and rejected it. Peel thinks it of great importance, and very
difficult to get out of. However, it will be got out of by
some particular case being tried, on which Hume, or whoever
brings it forward, will be beaten, and then it will sleep for
a time; but there stands and will stand the resolution on the
journals, and the House of Commons has admitted the principle
of dealing with actual vested interests, and not confining
their operation to the future.</p>

<p>There seems every probability of Stanley&rsquo;s West India
Bill being thrown out. The Saints, who at first had agreed
to support it, object to pay the twenty millions for emancipation
to take place twelve years hence, and the present
condition of the question seems to be that all parties are
dissatisfied with it, and there is nearly a certainty that it
will be received with horror by the planters, while the slaves
will no longer work when they find the fiat of their freedom
(however conditional or distant the final consummation may
be) has at length gone forth.</p>

<h3>July 20th, 1833</h3>

<p>I dropped into the House of Lords last night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and heard the Bishop of London reply severally to the Duke
of Newcastle and Lord Winchilsea, the first of whom muttered,
and the latter bellowed something I could not hear,
but I gathered that the last was on the subject of the King&rsquo;s
letter to the Bishops. The Bishop made very pertinent
answers to both, but the Duke of Wellington got up after
Winchilsea, and entreated nothing might be said upon the
subject, and put down discussion with that authority which
the Tories dare not resist, and which he exercised on this
occasion with the good sense and, above all, consideration
for public convenience and disdain of party rancour which
distinguish him above all men I have ever seen, and which
compel one to admire him in spite of the extraordinary
things he occasionally says and does.</p>

<p>George Villiers is going Minister to Madrid, instead of
Addington, who is so inefficient they are obliged to recall
him, and at this moment Madrid is the most important diplomatic
mission, with reference to the existing and the prospective
state of things. The Portuguese contest, the chance
of the King of Spain&rsquo;s death and a disputed succession, the
recognition of the South American colonies, and commercial
arrangements with this country, present a mass of interests
which demand considerable dexterity and judgment; besides,
Addington is a Tory, and does not act in the spirit of this
Government, so they will recall him without ceremony.
There is another Ambassador (Frederic Lamb) whose principles
are equally at variance with those of Palmerston, and
who is completely be-Metternich&rsquo;d, but his removal is out of
the question; he knows it, and no doubt conducts himself
accordingly. George Villiers told me that he touched incidentally
one day with Palmerston on Lamb&rsquo;s conduct in
some matter relating to Lord Granville, and he found that it
was sacred ground, and he only got, &lsquo;Ah, aw&mdash;yes, <i>Metternich</i>
is, I suppose, too old to mend now.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>July 21st, 1853</h3>

<p>The Duke of Wellington did not vote on
Friday night, but he made a bitter speech against Government,
and attacked Lord Anglesey very unnecessarily, when
Melbourne retorted on him very well. Lord Grey&rsquo;s reply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF RICHMOND.</span>
appears to have been exceedingly good. I met the Duke of
Richmond last night, and talked to him about the prospects
of Government, and suggested that if Stanley (when Althorp
retires) does not make it a <i>sine quâ non</i> that better discipline
should be observed in their ranks, the Government cannot
go on. He agreed, and said Stanley would, but he thought
the House of Lords were going on in such a way that before
three years there would be none. It appears to me totally
impossible for Stanley or anybody to go on without remodelling
the Government, and one of his difficulties would
be in getting rid of Richmond himself. He is utterly incapable,
entirely ignorant, and his pert smartness, saying
sharp things, cheering offensively, have greatly exasperated
many people against him in the House of Commons, and
these feelings of anger have been heightened by his taking
frequent opportunities of comporting himself with acrimony
towards the Duke of Wellington, though he always professes
great veneration for him, and talks as if he had constantly
abstained from anything like incivility or disrespect towards
him. It is remarkable certainly that his colleagues appear
to entertain a higher opinion of him than he deserves, and
you hear of one or another saying, &lsquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know the
Duke of Richmond.&rsquo; He has, in fact, that weight which a
man can derive from being positive, obstinate, pertinacious,
and busy, but his understanding lies in a nutshell, and his
information in a pin&rsquo;s head. He is, however, good-humoured,
a good fellow, and personally liked, particularly by Stanley
and Graham, who are of his own age, and have both the
same taste for sporting and gay occupations. The Tories
threaten mighty things in the Committee, but I don&rsquo;t think
they will attempt much.</p>

<h3>July 24th, 1833</h3>

<p>Divisions in both Houses last night. The
Duke of Wellington proposed an important amendment
(which he would afterwards have withdrawn, but his friends
would not let him), and he was beaten by fourteen. A great
division for Government <i>in the House of Lords</i>. In the Commons
166 minority for triennial Parliaments, and by every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sort of whipping and Billy Holmes&rsquo;s assistance a majority,
but only of sixty or seventy; fine work this.</p>

<h3>July 25th to 26th.&mdash;Half-past two in the morning</h3>

<p>Just
come home, having heard of the division in the House of
Lords, in which Ministers were beaten on what they call the
Suspension clause by two. Alvanley, Belhaven, and Clanricarde
got there too late. Gower could not attend, nor Lord
Granville. Lyndhurst came all the way from Norwich
(being on the circuit) to vote. The question is, what Ministers
will do&mdash;go on with the Bill, or throw it up, resign,
make Peers, or what? Nothing can be more silly than the
amendment, although it may be questioned whether it signifies
very materially; but the light in which Ministers see
it is this: are they to submit night after night to the
vexatious insolence of the Tories, who are constantly on the
watch to find some vulnerable point, and without intending
or daring to throw over their great measures, to mangle their
details as much as they can venture to do, and hold the Government
in a sort of subjugation and in a state of sufferance?
The Tory lords are perfectly rabid, and reckless of consequences,
regardless of the embarrassment they cause the
King, and of the aggravation of a state of things they
already think very bad, they care for nothing but the silly
vain pleasure of beating the Government, every day affording
fresh materials for the assaults that are made upon them by
the press, and fresh cause for general odium and contempt.
The Duke of Wellington has no power over them for good
purposes, and they will only follow him when he will lead
them on to some rash and desperate enterprise. This event
has affected people differently according to their several
views and opinions, but all are in eager curiosity to see what
the Government will do.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons things are no better than in
the House of Lords. Stanley was nearly beaten on the Apprenticeship
clause in the West Indian Bill on Wednesday night,
Macaulay opposing him; so yesterday morning he came
down to the House and gave it up. It is remarkable that
he made an admirable speech in defence of his clause,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">GOVERNMENT DEFEATED.</span>
was unusually and enthusiastically cheered, Macaulay&rsquo;s
speech falling very flat, and to all appearance the whole
House with Stanley, yet upon division he only carried it by
some seven or eight votes. It is said that after the vote he
could not do otherwise than give it up, but that if he had
taken a higher tone in his speech, and treated it as a compact
fixed and agreed upon, which nothing could shake, and to
which he was irrevocably pledged, he would have carried the
House with him, and have got a larger majority. But the
truth is that the House of Commons is in such a state that
it is next to impossible to say what Ministers can or ought
to do, or what the House will do. There is no such thing
as a great party knit together by community of opinion,
&lsquo;idem sentientes de republicâ.&rsquo; The Government conciliate
no attachment, command no esteem and respect, and have
no following. Althorp is liked, Stanley admired, but people
devote themselves to neither; every man is thinking of what
he shall say to his constituents, and how his vote will be
taken, and everything goes on (as it were) from hand to mouth;
by fits and starts the House of Commons seems rational
and moderate, and then they appear one day subservient to
the Ministers, another riotous, unruly, and fierce, ready to
abolish the Bishops and crush the House of Lords, and to
vote anything that is violent. The Tories in the House of
Commons are lukewarm, angry, frightened: they say, Why should
we come and support a Government that won&rsquo;t support
itself? the Government from weakness or facility, or
motives of personal feeling and partiality, suffers itself to be
bearded and thwarted by its own people, and does nothing.
Duncannon, on the triennial motion the other night, stayed in
the House of Lords and would not vote, there are some half-dozen
of them whose votes the Ministerial bench cannot
count upon. Then it is no small aggravation to the present
difficult state of things that Stanley does not appear to be a
man of much moral political firmness and courage, a timid
politician, <i>ignavus adversum lupos</i>. He is bold and spirited
against individuals, but timid against bodies, and with respect
to results. Labouchere went to him some time ago, and told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
him that it was evident a feeling was growing up in the
House of Commons against this Apprenticeship clause, and
that he had better make up his mind early what course he
should pursue, that if he meant to stand to it they would
support him, but if not, he had better give it up early and
from foresight rather than from necessity at last, but above
all, not to drag them through the mire by making them
support him, and then throwing them over. He declared he
would stand to his clause. They supported him, and he
threw them over. This will not do for a man who aspires
to be leader, and Sandon told me last night that men would
not be led by him, in spite of his talents, that when Althorp
went under Stanley&rsquo;s banner the friends of Government
would not enlist. God only knows how it all will end, and
out of such a mass of confusion, of so much violence and
folly and weakness, and the working of so many bad passions,
what will result, but any day the chance becomes less
of the elements of disorder being resolved into a state of
tranquillity and good government. It is every day more
apparent that with such a House of Commons, so elected, so
acted upon, no Government can feel secure; none can undertake
with confidence to carry on the affairs of the country.
It is difficult to describe the state of agitation into which the
minds of people of all persuasions are thrown by the continual
recurrence of these little events, of the feeling of
insecurity, of doubt, of apprehension which pervades all
classes. Nobody thinks the present Government can go on,
at the same time they can see no party and no individual
who could go on as well if they were to retire. The present
House of Commons it is found impossible to manage, but it
is believed that in the event of a dissolution another would
be much worse; in short, all is chaos, confusion, and uncertainty,
and the only thing in which all parties agree is that
things are very bad, and every day getting worse.</p>

<p>I dined the day before yesterday with old Lady Cork,
to meet the Bonapartes. There were Joseph, Lucien, Lucien&rsquo;s
daughter, the widow of Louis Bonaparte, Hortense&rsquo;s
son,<a name="FNA_21_05" id="FNA_21_05"></a><a href="#FN_21_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE BONAPARTES.</span>
Dudley Stuarts, Belhavens, Rogers, Lady Clarendon, and
Lady Davy and myself; not very amusing, but curious to
see these two men, one of whom would not be a King, when
he might have chosen almost any crown he pleased (conceive,
for instance, having refused the kingdom of Naples), and the
other, who was first King of Naples and then King of Spain,
commanded armies, and had the honour of being defeated at
Vittoria by the Duke of Wellington. There they sat, these
brothers of Napoleon, who once trampled upon all Europe,
and at whose feet the potentates of the earth bowed, two
simple, plain-looking, civil, courteous, smiling gentlemen.
They say Lucien is a very agreeable man, Joseph nothing.
Joseph is a caricature of Napoleon in his latter days, at least
so I guess from the pictures. He is taller, stouter, with the
same sort of face, but without the expression, and particularly
without the eagle eye. Lucien looked as if he had
once been like him, that is, his face in shape is like the
pictures of Napoleon when he was thin and young, but
Lucien is a very large, tall man. They talked little, but
stayed on in the evening, when there was a party, and received
very civilly all the people who were presented to
them. There was not the slightest affectation of royalty
in either. Lucien, indeed, had no occasion for any, but
a man who had ruled over two kingdoms might be excused
for betraying something of his former condition, but,
on the contrary, everything regal that he ever had about
him seemed to have been merged in his American citizenship,
and he looked more like a Yankee cultivator than a King of
Spain and the Indies. Though there was nothing to see in
Joseph, who is, I believe, a very mediocre personage, I could
not help gazing at him, and running over in my mind the
strange events in which he had been concerned in the course
of his life, and regarding him as a curiosity, and probably as
the most extraordinary living instance of the freaks of fortune
and instability of human grandeur.</p>

<h3>July 27th, 1833</h3>

<p>This affair in the House of Lords blew over.
The Patriots at Brookes&rsquo; were loud in their indignation, and
talked nonsense about dignity and resignation, and so forth,
but Lord Grey took the better course, and came down to
the House with a lecture, conceived in mild yet firm language,
and announced his intention of going on with the
Bill. Accordingly they got through the Committee last night
without further obstructions. The amendment is in fact so
trivial that I don&rsquo;t think he will attempt to re-establish the
original clause on the report, and if he does not, the Commons
(I am told) will not either.</p>

<h3>August 7th, 1833</h3>

<p>At Goodwood from Saturday se&rsquo;nnight to
Saturday last. Magnificent weather, numerous assemblage,
tolerable racing, but I did not win the great cup, which
I ought to have won, a most vile piece of ill luck, but good
fortune seems to have deserted me, and the most I can do is
not to lose.</p>

<p>George Villiers is appointed to Madrid, but he tells me
that he can neither see nor hear from Palmerston, that
though his appointment is in everybody&rsquo;s mouth it has never
been notified to him. All this negligence is because our
Foreign Secretary is engaged in the conferences, in which,
however, he gives no greater satisfaction to those he is concerned
with, for Talleyrand complains that he invariably
makes them wait from one to two hours, and Dedel says that
his manner is so insulting towards the Dutch nation and
King, and that on every occasion he acts with so much partiality
towards Belgium, that it is with the greatest difficulty
he can transact business with him at all. They say the Duke
of Wellington has scarcely missed a day during this session
in his attendance on the House of Lords, always in his place
from the beginning to the end of the debates, speaking and
evidently preparing himself on every subject, doing duty as
the head of a party.</p>

<h3>August 8th, 1833</h3>

<p>Met Lord Grey in the street; he said this
session had nearly done him up, and he must have repose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">GEORGE VILLIERS MINISTER AT MADRID.</span>
he talked of Portugal, of the desirableness of getting rid of
Pedro, and of putting Palmella at the head of the Government.
I said he must take care they did not establish too
liberal a Government. He replied the Portuguese certainly
were not fit for any such thing, and that the constitution
had undoubtedly done all the mischief; spoke of the Duke of
Wellington, and of his being always in the House of Lords,
speaking on anything, and generally not well, that he had
made a most tiresome bad speech on the India Charter
question, etc. Brougham&rsquo;s Privy Council Bill has, I perceive,
passed the House of Commons, having gone through both
Houses without a syllable said upon it in either.</p>

<p>George Villiers is at last acknowledged Minister to
Madrid. He told me he was with Palmerston at his house
yesterday morning, and was much struck with his custom of
receiving all his numerous visitors and applicants in the
order in which they arrive, be their rank what it may.
Neumann told him he had never known him vary in this
practice, or deviate from it in anybody&rsquo;s favour. It is a
merit. There seems little danger of any movement on the
part of Spain, for Zea Bermudez (Palmerston told George
Villiers) is struck to the earth by the events in Portugal,
and only anxious to curry favour with England.</p>

<h3>August 15th, 1833</h3>

<p>At Council yesterday to swear in James
Parke and Bosanquet (who did not come) Privy Councillors,
in order to carry into operation the Chancellor&rsquo;s new Bill
for the establishment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council.</p>

<h3>August 20th, 1833</h3>

<p>To Stoke on Saturday with Creevey
and Lemarchant, the Chancellor&rsquo;s secretary. The Chancellor
and others of the Ministry were to have come, but they all
dined at Blackwall. Brougham, Plunket, and John Russell
came the next day. Brougham is not so talkative as he
was; his dignities, his labours, and the various cares of his
situation have dashed his gaiety, and pressed down his once
elastic spirits; however, he was not otherwise than cheerful
and lively. Plunket I never met before, he was pretty much at
his ease, and talked sufficiently without exhibiting anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
remarkable. Lemarchant is a clever, industrious fellow,
whom I remember at Eton. The Chancellor&rsquo;s secretaryship
must be no sinecure, and he has particularly distinguished
himself by his reports of the debates in the House of Commons.
He goes there every night, and forwards to the Chancellor from
time to time an account of the debate, and the manner of it,
very well executed indeed. He talked to me of Brougham&rsquo;s
labours and their intensity, which put me in mind of his
gasconading to Sefton a year or two ago about his idleness,
and finding the Great Seal a mere plaything; Lemarchant
said that by severe and constant application he had made
himself very tolerably acquainted with equity law, and very
extensively with cases. I find from Sefton that he means
to propose next year that his salary should be reduced to
8,000&#8467;. a year, and that the new Equity Judges should be paid
out of what he now has. I believe he is liberal about money,
and not careless, but I have some doubts whether this project
will be executed. Lemarchant told me that the cause of
Sugden&rsquo;s inveterate animosity against Brougham was this&mdash;that
in a debate in the House of Commons, Sugden in his
speech took occasion to speak of Mr. Fox, and said that he
had no great respect for his authority, on which Brougham
merely said, loud enough to be heard all over the House, and
in that peculiar tone which strikes like a dagger, &lsquo;Poor Fox.&rsquo;
The words, the tone, were electrical, everybody burst into
roars of laughter, Sugden was so overwhelmed that he said
afterwards it was with difficulty he could go on, and he
vowed that he never could forgive this sarcasm.</p>

<p>Sefton talked to me of Brougham&rsquo;s reluctance when the
Government was formed to take the Great Seal; after they
had offered him the Attorney-Generalship, which he so indignantly
refused, they sent Sefton to cajole him and get him
to take the Seal. He wanted to be made Master of the
Rolls, and left in the House of Commons, the Seal being
put in Commission. This they would not hear of, naturally
enough not choosing to exist at his mercy in the House of
Commons, and rely upon his doubtful and capricious support.
It was very well for him to act the part of Atlas, and bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM AS CHANCELLOR.</span>
the Government on his shoulders, but they shrewdly enough
guessed that they would not ride on them very comfortably,
that they would be considerably jolted, and perhaps at last
shoved off. He, on the other hand, would not suffer anybody
to be Chancellor but himself; and at last, with many misgivings,
he yielded to the gentle violence which would make
him the first officer of the Crown. Great was his lamentation
at this necessity. &lsquo;How,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;am I fallen! As
member for Yorkshire in the House of Commons, what a
position was mine.&rsquo; Sefton tried to comfort him by representing
that &lsquo;the fall&rsquo; upon the woolsack was somewhat of
the softest, and that a few years ago he would not have
considered it so grievous a misfortune if it had been foretold
him that he should be seated there at such a time.</p>

<p>After dinner on Sunday Brougham talked of the Reform
Bill and its first appearance in the House of Commons. He
said that once allowed to take root there it could not be
crushed, and that their only opportunity was thrown away
by the Tories. Had Peel risen at once and declared that he
would not even discuss such a measure, that it was revolution,
and opposed its being brought in, he would have thrown
it out, and if he had then come down with a moderate
measure, it would have satisfied the country <i>for the time</i>.
This is exactly what William Banks said to me last year, and
the very thing Peel had intended to do, and from which he
was deterred by Granville Somerset. The Duke of Wellington
has continued to attend in the House of Lords day after
day, proposing alterations and amendments to all the Bills,
evidently reading hard, and preparing himself for each
occasion, always loaded with papers. Lyndhurst said to
somebody, &lsquo;I shall attend no more, what&rsquo;s the use of it?
The Duke comes down every day, and tries to make the Bills
<i>better</i>; if I could make them <i>worse</i>, I would come too.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>August 22nd, 1833</h3>

<p>Called on Madame de Lieven yesterday,
who is just come back from Petersburg, <i>rayonnante</i> at her
reception and treatment. The Emperor went out to sea to
meet her, took her into his own boat, when they landed he
drove her to the palace, and carried her into the Empress&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
room, who was <i>en chemise</i>. She told me a comical anecdote
illustrative of the good humour of the Emperor (who, she
says, is an angel), and of the free and frank reception he
gives to strangers. In the midst of some splendid military
fêtes, which terminated with a sham siege by 50,000 of his
guards the last day, word was brought him that two strange-looking
men had presented themselves at the lines, and requested
to be allowed to see what was going on. They said
they were English, had come from Scotland on purpose to
see the Russian man&oelig;uvres, and had started from Petersburg
under the direction of a laquais de place, who had
conducted them to where they heard the firing of the cannon.
The Emperor ordered them to be admitted, received them
with the greatest civility, and desired apartments to be prepared
for them in the palace (Peterhof), at the same time
inviting them to dine with him, and be present at a ball he
gave at night. She said that one was a Don Quixote sort
of figure; they called themselves Johnstone. The Emperor
asked her if she knew them. She said no, but that there
were many of that name in England. There they remained,
enchanted, astonished, behaving, however, perfectly well.
After seeing all the sights, they were one evening led into a
great hall, where all sorts of pastimes were going on, and
among others a <i>Montagne Russe</i> (of which the Emperor is
passionately fond). He is a very tall powerful man, and his
way is to be placed at the top of the machine, when a man
mounts astride on his shoulders, and another on his, and so
on till there are fourteen; when a signal is given, with the
rapidity of lightning down they go. On this occasion the
Emperor took the Johnstones on his back, and she says their
astonishment at the position they occupied, and at the
rapidity of the descent, was beyond everything amusing.
They were asked how they liked it, and they said they
thought it &lsquo;very good fun,&rsquo; and should like to begin again.
So they were allowed to divert themselves in this way for an
hour. Bligh told her afterwards that these men returned to
Petersburg their heads turned, and utterly bewildered with,
such an unexpected reception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">AFFAIRS OF PORTUGAL.</span>
In her serious talk the Princess said that the Emperor
was full of moderation and desire for peace, &lsquo;s&rsquo;il y a des orages
ce ne sera pas de ce côté qu&rsquo;ils viendront,&rsquo; that he could not
comprehend the English Parliament, nor the sort of language
which was held there about him, that he was &lsquo;le plus généreux,
le plus humain, le meilleur des hommes,&rsquo; that they
believed all the lies which were &lsquo;débités sur les affaires de
Pologne, qui enfin est notre affaire, qu&rsquo;il était peu connu ici,
qu&rsquo;elle avait vu en Russie beaucoup de respects, beaucoup
d&rsquo;amour pour l&rsquo;Empereur, et voilà tout.&rsquo; In short, she is
returned in a state of intoxication, and her adoration for the
Emperor is only exceeded by that which she has for the
Empress.</p>

<h3>August 24th, 1833</h3>

<p>Matters have taken a bad turn in
Portugal. Bourmont is marching on Lisbon with 18,000
men, &lsquo;regna il terror nella citta.&rsquo; William Russell, in a fit
of enthusiasm, says, &lsquo;the capital must be saved even at the
hazard of a war.&rsquo; Admiral Parker says he shall land 1,200
marines and make them occupy the forts. Our Government
are in great confusion and alarm, and have despatched a swift
steamer to Parker to desire him to do no such thing; but
the steamer will probably arrive too late, and if Bourmont is
really there, we shall cut a pretty figure with our non-intervention,
for Parker will probably have to surrender the forts
to Miguel. I dined with Talleyrand yesterday, who is
furious, laughing non-intervention to scorn; and he told me
he had for the last ten days been endeavouring to get the
Government to take a decided part. What he advised was
that we should recognise Donna Maria and the Regency appointed
by the Charter; that is, Donna Isabella Regent, with
a Council to be comprised of Palmella, Villa Flor, and any
other; that our Minister should be directed to acknowledge
<i>no other government</i>, and at the same time concert with
Palmella that Pedro should be sent away, and the constitution
be suspended till the Queen shall be of age. Pedro has
committed, since he was in Lisbon, every folly and atrocity
he could squeeze into so small a space of time; imprisoning,
confiscating, granting monopolies, attacking the Church, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
putting forth the constitution in its most offensive shape. I
suspect we shall have made a sad mess of this business.</p>

<p>Just come from the Duke of Wellington; talked about
Portugal and the intercepted letters; the writer said that he
(the Duke) had told Neumann he approved of Bourmont&rsquo;s
going, whereas he thought it an objectionable nomination,
because he had formerly deserted from the Portuguese
service.<a name="FNA_21_06" id="FNA_21_06"></a><a href="#FN_21_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
He had never had any communication with these agents,
and did not believe Aberdeen had had any either: he said
Lisbon was more defensible than Oporto, but required more
men. Talking of Miguel, the Duke related that he was at
Strathfieldsaye with Palmella, where in the library they were
settling the oath that Miguel should take, Miguel would pay
no attention, and instead of going into the business and saying
what oath he would consent to take (the question was
whether he should swear fidelity to Pedro or to Maria) he sat
flirting with the Princess Thérèse Esterhazy. The Duke
said to Palmella, &lsquo;This will never do, he must settle the terms
of the oath, and if he is so careless in an affair of such
moment, he will never do his duty.&rsquo; Palmella said, &lsquo;Oh, leave
him to us, we will manage him.&rsquo; He had no idea of overturning
the constitution and playing false when he went
there, but was persuaded by his mother and terrified by the
lengths to which the constitutional party was disposed to go.
The Duke said the Government would be very foolish to
interfere for Pedro, who was a ruffian, and for the constitution,
which was odious, and that Pedro would never have
more than the ground he stood on; talked of our foreign
policy, his anxiety for peace, but of France as our &lsquo;natural
enemy!&rsquo; and of the importance of maintaining our influence
in Spain, which so long as we did we should have nothing to
fear from France.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_21_06" id="FN_21_06"></a><a href="#FNA_21_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
Bourmont was an emigrant, and went into the Portuguese service.
When Junot came to Portugal he joined him, was taken into the French
service, in which he continued to rise, till he deserted just before the
battle of Waterloo from Napoleon to Louis XVIII.</p></div>

<h3>September 3rd, 1833</h3>

<p>On Wednesday last when the King&rsquo;s
speech was read there was no Council. Brougham brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RESULTS OF THE REFORM BILL.</span>
Sir Alexander Johnston, formerly Chief Justice in Ceylon, to
be sworn a Privy Councillor without giving any notice, consequently
I was not there. The King, therefore, comes again
to-morrow on purpose, and, what is unpleasant, desired a
Clerk of the Council might always be in attendance when
there was anything going on. This, I suppose, His Majesty
will repeat to me himself to-morrow. The Parliament is at
last up; it was a fine sight the day the King went down, the
weather splendid, and park full of people, with guards
mounted and dismounted, making a picturesque show. He
was very coolly received, for there is no doubt there never
was a King less respected. George IV., with all his occasional
unpopularity, could always revive the external appearance
of loyalty when he gave himself the trouble.</p>

<p>The Parliament is up, and not before people were dead
sick of it, and had dropped out of town one by one till
hardly any Parliament was left. It may be worth while to
take a little survey of the present condition of things as
compared with what it was a few months ago, and consider
at this resting time what has been the practical effect
of the great measure of Reform, without going very deeply
into the question. The Reform Bill was carried <i>in toto</i>, the
Tories having contrived that everything that was attempted
should be gained by the Reformers. No excuse, therefore,
was left for the Parliament, and if &lsquo;the people&rsquo; did not
choose a good one it was their own fault. It was chosen,
and when it met was found to be composed of a majority of
supporters of the present Government, a certain number of
Tories, not enough to be powerful, and many Radicals, who
soon proved to be wholly inefficient. It speedily became
manifest that in point of ability it was not only inferior to
the last, but perhaps to any Parliament that has sat for
many years. There were 350 new members (or some such
number), but not one man among them of shining or remarkable
talent; Cobbett, Silk, Buckingham, Roebuck, and
such men soon found their level and sunk into insignificance.
The House appeared at first to be very unruly, not under
the command of Government, talkative, noisy, and ill-constituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for the transaction of business. After a little while
it got better in this respect, the majority, however, though
evidently determined to support Government, would not be
<i>commanded</i> by it, and even men in place often took up
crotchets of their own, and voted against Government
measures; but whenever the Ministers seemed to be in
danger they always found efficient support, and on the Malt
Tax the House even stultified itself to uphold them. As the
session proceeded the men who gained reputation and
established the greatest personal influence were Peel and
Stanley; Macaulay rather lost than gained; Althorp lost
entirely, but the weight of his blunders and unfitness could
not sink him, his personal character and good humour
always buoyed him up. The great measures, some of the
greatest that any Parliament ever dealt with, were got
through with marvellous facility. They did not for the
most part come on till late in the session, when the House
had got tired, and the East India Charter Bill was carried
through most of the stages in empty Houses. The measures
have generally evinced a Conservative character, and the
Parliament has not shown any disposition to favour subversive
principles or to encourage subversive language. It has
been eminently liberal in point of money, granting all that
Ministers asked without the slightest difficulty; twenty
millions for the West Indians, a million for the Irish clergy,
were voted almost by acclamation. Hume cut no figure in
this Parliament. Notwithstanding apprehensions and predictions
the Government has contrived to carry on the
business of the country very successfully, and great reforms
have been accomplished in every department of the State,
which do not seem liable to any serious objections, and in the
midst of many troubles, of much complaining and bickering;
the country has been advancing in prosperity, and recovering
rapidly from the state of sickly depression in which it lay at
the end of last year. It is fair to compare the state of
affairs now and then, merely reciting facts, and let the
praise rest where it may, whether it be due to the wisdom
of men or the result of that disposition to right itself which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SURVEY OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRS.</span>
has always appeared inherent in the British commonwealth.
Some months ago there appeared every prospect of a war in
Europe; the French were in Belgium, whence many predicted
they would never be got away; Ireland was in a
flame, every post brought the relation of fresh horrors and
atrocities; in England trade was low, alarm and uncertainty
prevalent, and a general disquietude pervaded the nation,
some fearing and others desiring change, some expecting,
others dreading the great things which a Reformed Parliament
would do. The session is over, and a Reformed Parliament
turns out to be very much like every other Parliament,
except that it is rather differently and somewhat less
ably composed than its predecessors. The hopes and the
fears of mankind have been equally disappointed, and after
all the clamour, confusion, riots, conflagrations, furies,
despair, and triumphs through which we have arrived at
this consummation, up to the present time, at least, matters
remain pretty much as they were, except that the Whigs
have got possession of the power which the Tories have lost.
We continue at peace, and with every prospect of so being
for some time, we are on good terms with France, and by
degrees inducing the French to extend their incipient principles
of free trade, to the benefit of both countries. In Ireland
there never has been a period for many years when the
country was so quiet; it may not last, but so it is at the
present moment. In England trade flourishes, running in a
deep and steady stream, there are improvement and employment
in all its branches. The landed interest has suffered
and suffers still, but the wages of labour have not fallen
with the rents of landlords, and the agricultural labourers
were never better off. Generally there is a better spirit
abroad, less discontent, greater security, and those vague
apprehensions are lulled to rest which when in morbid
activity, carrying themselves from one object to another, are
partly the cause and partly the effect of an evil state of
things. We hear nothing now of associations, unions, and
public meetings, and (compared with what it was) the world
seems in a state of repose.</p>

<h3>September 5th, 1833</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday, the
Speaker<a name="FNA_22_01" id="FNA_22_01"></a><a href="#FN_22_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
was
made a Knight of the Bath to his great delight. It is a reward
for his conduct during the Session, in which he has
done Government good and handsome service. He told them
before it began that he would undertake to ride the new
House, but it must be with a snaffle bridle. Bosanquet and
Sir Alexander Johnston were made Privy Councillors to sit
in the Chancellor&rsquo;s new Court. The Privy Council is as numerous
as a moderate-sized club, and about as well composed.
Awful storms these last few days, and enormous
damage done, the weather like the middle of winter.</p>

<h3>September 6th, 1833</h3>

<p>Yesterday the announcement of Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD WELLESLEY.</span>
Wellesley&rsquo;s appointment to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
was received with as great astonishment as I ever saw.
Once very brilliant, probably never very efficient, he is now
worn out and <i>effete</i>. It is astonishing that they should send
such a man, and one does not see why, because it is difficult
to find a good man, they should select one of the very worst
they could hit upon. It is a ridiculous appointment, which
is the most objectionable of all. For years past he has lived
entirely out of the world. He comes to the House of Lords,
and talks of making a speech every now and then, of which
he is never delivered, and he comes to Court, where he sits
in a corner and talks (as those who know him say) with as
much fire and liveliness as ever, and with the same neat,
shrewd causticity that formerly distinguished him; but such
scintillations as these prove nothing as to his fitness for
business and government, and as he was quite unfit for
these long ago, it is scarcely to be supposed that retirement
and increased age and infirmities should have made him less
so now.<a name="FNA_22_02" id="FNA_22_02"></a><a href="#FN_22_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
They have judiciously waited till Parliament is up
before the appointment was made known. Lord Wellesley
is said to be in the hands of Blake the Remembrancer, a
dangerous Jesuitical fellow.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_22_02" id="FN_22_02"></a><a href="#FNA_22_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[This opinion of Lord Wellesley was, however, speedily changed by
his successful and vigorous administration of Ireland. See <i>infra</i>, November
14th.]</p></div>

<h3>September 10th, 1833</h3>

<p>At Gorhambury on Saturday till Monday.
Dined on Friday with Talleyrand, a great dinner
to M. Thiers, the French Minister of Commerce, a little
man, about as tall as Sheil, and as mean and vulgar
looking, wearing spectacles, and with a squeaking voice.
He was editor of the &lsquo;National,&rsquo; an able writer, and one of
the principal instigators of the Revolution of July. It is said
that he is a man of great ability and a good speaker, more
in the familiar English than the bombastical French style.
Talleyrand has a high opinion of him. He wrote a history of
the Revolution, which he now regrets; it is well done, but
the doctrine of fatalism which he puts forth in it he thinks
calculated to injure his reputation as a statesman. I met him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
again at dinner at Talleyrand&rsquo;s yesterday with another great
party, and last night he started on a visit to Birmingham
and Liverpool.</p>

<p>After dinner on Friday I had rather a curious conversation
with Esterhazy, who said he wanted to know what I
thought of the condition of this country. I told him that
I thought everything was surprisingly improved, and gave
my reasons for thinking so. He then went off and said that
these were his opinions also, and he had written home in
this strain, that Neumann had deceived his Government,
giving them very different accounts, that it was no use
telling them what they might wish to hear, but that he was
resolved to tell them the truth, and make them understand
how greatly they were deceiving themselves if they counted
upon the decadence or want of power of this country; a
great deal more of the same sort, which proves that the
Austrian Court were all on the <i>qui vive</i> to find out that we
are paralysed, and that their political conduct is in fact
influenced by their notion of our actual position. They probably
hardly knew what they would be at, but their hatred
and dread of revolutionary principles are so great that they
are always on the watch for a good opportunity of striking a
blow at them, which they know they can only do through
England and France. They would therefore willingly believe
that the political power of England is diminished, and
Neumann, who wrote in the spirit of a disappointed Tory
rather than of an impartial Foreign Minister, no doubt
flattered their desires in this respect. Last night I sat by
Dedel, the Dutch Minister, who told me he knew Neumann
had given very false accounts (not intentionally) to his
Government, that Wessenberg took much juster views, and
he (Dedel) agreed with Esterhazy, who said that nobody
could understand this country who had not had long experience
of it, and that he found it impossible to make his
Government comprehend it, or give entire credit to what he
said. Dedel told me that Holland is ruined, that the day of
reckoning will come, when they will discover what a state of
bankruptcy they are in, that the spirit of the nation had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">QUEEN OF PORTUGAL IN ENGLAND.</span>
been kept up by excitement, and that therein lay the dexterity
of the King and his Government, but that this
factitious enthusiasm was rapidly passing away. They now
pay fifty millions of florins interest of debt, about four
millions sterling, and their population is not above two
millions.</p>

<p>The young Queen of Portugal goes to Windsor to-day.
The King was at first very angry at her coming to England,
but when he found that Louis Philippe had treated her with
incivility, he changed his mind, and resolved to receive her
with great honours. He hates Louis Philippe and the
French with a sort of Jack Tar animosity. The other day
he gave a dinner to one of the regiments at Windsor, and
as usual he made a parcel of foolish speeches, in one of
which, after descanting upon their exploits in Spain against
the French, he went on: &lsquo;Talking of France, I must say that
whether at peace or at war with that country, I shall always
consider her as our natural enemy, and whoever may be her
King or <i>ruler</i>, I shall keep a watchful eye for the purpose of
repressing her ambitious encroachments.&rsquo; If he was not
such an ass that nobody does anything but laugh at what he
says, this would be very important. Such as he is, it is
nothing. &lsquo;What can you expect&rsquo; (as I forget who said)
&lsquo;from a man with a head like a pineapple?&rsquo; His head is
just of that shape.</p>

<p>The history of the French King&rsquo;s behaviour is that he
wanted the young Queen of Portugal to marry the Duke de
Nemours, and when he found that impossible (for we should
have opposed it) he proposed Prince Charles of Naples, his
nephew. This was likewise rejected. The Emperor Don
Pedro wants the Duke of Leuchtenberg, his wife&rsquo;s brother,
to marry
her.<a name="FNA_22_03" id="FNA_22_03"></a><a href="#FN_22_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
This Duke went to Havre the other day, where
the Préfet refused to admit him, though he went with (or
to) his sister, pleading the law excluding Napoleon&rsquo;s family.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
He went to the Préfet to say that he protested against such
application of the law, but, as he would not make any disturbance
there, desired to have his passports <i>visé</i> for Munich,
and off he went. At the same time he wrote a letter to
Palmerston, which George Villiers, to whom Palmerston
showed it, told me was exceedingly good. He said that
though he did not know Palmerston he ventured to address
him, as the Minister of the greatest and freest country in the
world, for the purpose of explaining what had happened, and
to clear himself from the misrepresentations that would be
made as to his motives and intentions in joining his sister;
that it was true that Don Pedro had wished him to marry
his daughter, and that he had written him a letter, of which
he enclosed a copy. This was a very well written letter,
begging the Emperor to pause and consider of this projected
match, and setting forth all the reasons why it might not be
advantageous for her; in short, Villiers says, exhibiting a
very remarkable degree of disinterestedness, and of longsighted
views with regard to the situation of Portugal and
the general politics of Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_22_03" id="FN_22_03"></a><a href="#FNA_22_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[Queen Donna Maria did eventually many the young Duke of
Leuchtenberg, son of Prince Eugène Beauharnais and a Bavarian Princess.
But he survived his marriage only a few months, and died of a fever at
Lisbon.]</p></div>

<p>He told me another anecdote at the same time. Palmerston
showed him a letter he had received from Charles Napier, in
which, talking of the possible interference of Spain, he said;
&lsquo;Your Lordship knows that I have only to sail with my fleet
(enumerating a respectable squadron of different sizes) to
Cadiz, and I can create a revolution in five minutes throughout
the whole South of Spain.&rsquo; Palmerston seems to have
been a little amused and a little alarmed at this fanfaronade,
in which there is, however, a great deal of truth.
He said that of course they should not allow Napier to do
any such thing, but as nothing else could prevent him if we
did not, the Spaniards may be made to understand that we
shall not be at the trouble of muzzling this bull-dog if they
do not behave with civility and moderation.</p>

<h3>London, November 13th, 1833</h3>

<p>Nothing written for nearly
two months. I remained in town till the end of September,
when I went to Newmarket, and afterwards to
Buckenham, where I met Sir Robert Peel. He is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SYDNEY SMITH AND MACAULAY.</span>
agreeable in society, it is a toss up whether he talks or not,
but if he thaws, and is in good humour and spirits, he
is lively, entertaining, and abounding in anecdotes, which
he tells extremely well. I came back to town on Friday
last, the 8th, dined with the Poodle, and found Rogers,
Moore, and Westmacott (the son); a very agreeable dinner.
On Sunday dined with Rogers, Moore, Sydney Smith,
Macaulay. Sydney less vivacious than usual, and somewhat
overpowered and talked down by what Moore called the
&lsquo;flumen sermonis&rsquo; of Macaulay. Sydney calls Macaulay &lsquo;a
book in breeches.&rsquo; All that this latter says, all that he
writes, exhibits his great powers and astonishing information,
but I don&rsquo;t think he is agreeable. It is more than
society requires, and not exactly of the kind; his figure, face,
voice, and manner are all bad; he astonishes and instructs,
he sometimes entertains, seldom amuses, and still seldomer
pleases. He wants variety, elasticity, gracefulness; his is a
roaring torrent, and not a meandering stream of talk. I
believe we would all of us have been glad to exchange some
of his sense for some of Sydney Smith&rsquo;s nonsense. He
told me that he had read Sir Charles Grandison fifteen
times!</p>

<p>Not a word of news, political or other; the Ministers are
all come, Spain and Portugal potter on with their civil contests
and create uneasiness, though of a languid kind. I
came to town for a meeting at the Council Office, the first
under Brougham&rsquo;s new Bill, to make rules and regulations
for the proceedings of the Court. All the lawyers attended,
not much done, but there do not seem to be any great difficulties.
There was Brougham, with Leach next him, and
Lyndhurst opposite, all smirks and civility, he and Leach
quite fondling one another. Dined yesterday with Stanley,
who gave me a commission to bet a hundred for him on
Bentley against Berbastes for the Derby, and talked of
racing after dinner with as much zest as if he was on the
turf. Who (to see him and hear him thus) would take
him for the greatest orator and statesman of the day?</p>

<h3>November 14th, 1833</h3>

<p>Dined with Sefton yesterday; after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dinner came in the Chancellor in good humour and spirits;
talked of Lord Wellesley, who, since he has been in Ireland,
has astonished everybody by his activity and assiduity in
business. He appeared, before he went, in the last stage of
decrepitude, and they had no idea the energy was in him;
but they say he is quite a new man, and it is not merely a
splash, but real and bonâ-fide business that he does. The
Chancellor talked over some of the passages of the
Queen&rsquo;s trial, to which he loves to revert. It was about the
liturgy. The negotiations which had taken place at Apsley
House between the Duke of Wellington and Lord Castlereagh
on one part and Brougham and Denman on the other were
broken off on that point. It was then agreed to refer the
matter to others; the Duke and Castlereagh were to meet
Lord Fitzwilliam and Sefton; a queer choice, old Fitzwilliam
a driveller, and Sefton, with all his sharpness, totally unfit for
the office of negotiator in a grave matter. He can&rsquo;t be grave,
life itself is to him a plaything; but the night before they
were to meet, Fitzwilliam took fright, and backed out. Notice
was sent to the other party, but they did not get it, owing to
some mistake. In the morning Brougham came to Sefton
and asked him to drive him up to the Queen&rsquo;s house, and
as they passed through Grosvenor Square, to their amazement
they saw Wellington and Castlereagh alighting (full dressed
for the levée) at Lord Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s door. Sefton went into
the house, and found them already in the dining-room, the
table covered with papers, when an explanation ensued, on
which they had to bundle up their papers again and trot off.</p>

<p>When the deputation from the House of Commons went
up with the address to the Queen, entreating her to come
to terms (Banks, Wortley, Acland, and Wilberforce), she
had got all her Council assembled, and before receiving the
deputation from the Commons, she asked their advice.
Brougham said that she was disposed to acquiesce, but
wanted <i>them</i> to advise her to do so, and that her intention
was, if they had, to act on that advice, but to save her popularity
by throwing the odium on them, and devoting them to
popular execration. He therefore resolved, and his brethren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BROUGHAM&rsquo;S ANECDOTES OF QUEEN CAROLINE.</span>
likewise, to give no advice at all; and when she turned to
him, and said, &lsquo;What do you think I ought to do?&rsquo; he replied,
in a sort of speech which he gave very comically, &lsquo;Your
Majesty is undoubtedly the best judge of the answer you
ought to give, and I am certain that your own feelings will
point out to you the proper course.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, but what is
your opinion?&rsquo; &lsquo;Madam, I certainly have a strong opinion
on the subject, but I think there cannot be a shadow of
doubt of what your Majesty ought to do, and there can be
no doubt your Majesty&rsquo;s admirable sense will suggest to you
what that opinion is.&rsquo; &lsquo;Humph,&rsquo; said she, and flung from
him; turning to Denman, &lsquo;And Mr. Solicitor, what is your
opinion?&rsquo; &lsquo;Madam, I concur entirely in that which has
been expressed by the Attorney-General;&rsquo; and so they all
repeated. She was furious, and being left to herself she
resolved not to agree. Sefton was on horseback among the
crowd which was waiting impatiently to hear the result of
the interview and her determination. He had agreed with
Brougham that as soon as she had made up her mind he
should come to the window and make him a sign. He <i>was
to stroke his chin</i> if she refused, and do something else, I
forget what, if she agreed. Accordingly arrived Brougham
at the window, all in gown and wig, and as soon as he caught
Sefton&rsquo;s eye began stroking his chin. This was enough for
Sefton, who (as he declares) immediately began telling
people in the crowd who were wondering and doubting and
hoping that they might rely upon it she would &lsquo;stand by
them,&rsquo; and not accept the terms.</p>

<h3>November 21st, 1833</h3>

<p>Another meeting at the Council Office
the day before yesterday. The Chancellor arranging everything,
but proposing many things which meet with opposition,
wants people to be allowed to plead <i>in formâ pauperis</i>
before the Privy Council, which they object to. I have
doubts whether this Court will work well after all, and foresee
great difficulty about the rota; everybody had something
to prevent their attendance; however we meet on the 27th
for the despatch of business. I have just finished &lsquo;Clarissa;&rsquo;
never was so interested or affected by any book.</p>

<h3>November 28th, 1833</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Yesterday the first meeting under
Brougham&rsquo;s new Bill of &lsquo;the Judicial Committee,&rsquo; the Chancellor,
Vice-Chancellor, Baron Parke, Justice Bosanquet, and
Erskine (Chief Judge in Bankruptcy). I can&rsquo;t perceive that
matters are likely to go on a bit better than when one Judge
sat there, though the Chancellor endeavours to confer all the
importance he can on his Committee, that he may hereafter
figure there himself. There has been a lively controversy
between the Whig and Tory papers, of which he has been
the object, the former lauding his law reforms, the latter
attacking his judicial incompetence. It is actually true
that hardly any original causes are brought before him, and
he has little business except appeals which must come into
his Court. He feels himself every day in a more unpleasant
predicament, and of course has a growing impatience to get
rid of his judicial duties. That he will by a series of tricks
wriggle out of them there can be no doubt, for just now he
can do whatever he pleases. What he wants is to be Prime
Minister; his restless and versatile mind will then find sufficient
occupation, and there is no department of Government
which he does not think himself capable of presiding over,
leaving as he would do all troublesome details to be worked
out by others.</p>

<h3>November 30th, 1833</h3>

<p>A long sitting of our Court yesterday.
The Chancellor comes regularly. Jenner (the King&rsquo;s Advocate)
told me that he believed the Chancellor&rsquo;s object was
to transfer all appeals from the House of Lords to the Privy
Council. Lyndhurst (whom I met at Mrs. Fox&rsquo;s) said that
it was quite true that he had no business in his own Court,
for nobody would plead there, that he wanted to be Prime
Minister, retaining the emoluments and patronage of the
Great Seal, and getting rid of its duties. There can be no
doubt that he does, and if Lord Grey dies, or is ill (in which
case he will resign), he probably will succeed. It is amusing
to see Brougham&rsquo;s tricks in small things; his present object
is to raise the Judicial Committee as much as he can, and
bring all the business there he can collect; in order to increase
the appeals he proposed to allow of them from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STRATFORD CANNING AND DEDEL.</span>
Indian Courts <i>in formâ pauperis</i>. This, however, was strenuously
resisted by all the Judges and others present, and as
he always takes the lead in all discussions relating to rules
and regulations, when he found that the unanimous opinion
of the Committee was the other way, he turned himself
round and argued against his own proposal, stating or anticipating
the objections of the others, just insinuating incidentally
counter-arguments, and ending by letting the
question remain in abeyance.</p>

<p>Madame de Lieven told me an anecdote of Stratford
Canning which highly delighted her, because it justified the
resistance which the Court of Russia made to his nomination
to that Embassy. The other day Dedel called on
Palmerston. When shown into the waiting-room, he said,
&lsquo;Tell Lord Palmerston that the Dutch Minister will be glad
to see him,&rsquo; when a man who was there, and whom he did
not know, jumped up and said, &lsquo;And I desire you will tell
Lord Palmerston that I have been waiting here these two
hours, and that I expect to see him before anybody else;&rsquo;
and then, turning to Dedel, &lsquo;Sir, this is too bad; two persons
have been already shown in to Lord Palmerston, both of
whom came after me, and I expect that you will not go in
to his Lordship till after me.&rsquo; Dedel, who is the mildest
and civillest of men, replied, &lsquo;Sir, far be it from me to dispute
your right, and I assure you I have no desire to go in
before you, but I only beg that if Lord Palmerston should
send for me first you will understand that I cannot help
going;&rsquo; and then the other, &lsquo;Sir, I am Sir Stratford Canning.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And I am Mr. Dedel.&rsquo; This extraordinary scene
he told Madame de Lieven, not knowing what had passed
about the mission. Touching that affair, there is an
understanding that he shall not go there, and no other
Ambassador is to be named till it is quite convenient to
Palmerston.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday I met Sydney Smith at dinner
at Poodle Byng&rsquo;s, when a conversation occurred which produced
a curious coincidence. We were talking of Vaughan,
the Minister in America, how dull he appeared, and yet how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
smart and successful had been &lsquo;The Siege of Saragossa,&rsquo;
which he published at the time of the Spanish war. Sydney
Smith said that the truth was he had not written a word of
it, and on being questioned further said that he was himself
the author. Vaughan, who was a friend of his, had given
him the materials, and he had composed the narrative. He
then went on to say that it was not the only instance of the
kind, for that the celebrated pamphlet which had been attributed
to Lady Canning had not been written by her, not a
word of it, that it had been written by Stapleton. I said
that I had it in my power to contradict this, for that I had
been privy to the composition of it, had seen the manuscript,
and had at her request undertaken the task of revising and
correcting it. Thus were two mistakes accidentally cleared
up, by the circumstance of the only persons who could have
explained them being present.</p>

<h3>December 2nd, 1833</h3>

<p>I went yesterday to Edward Irving&rsquo;s
chapel to hear him preach, and witness the exhibition of the
tongues. The chapel was formerly West&rsquo;s picture gallery,
oblong, with a semicircular recess at one end; it has been
fitted up with galleries all round, and in the semicircle there
are tiers of benches, in front of which is a platform with an
elevated chair for Irving himself, and a sort of desk before
it; on each side the chair are three arm-chairs, on which
three other preachers sat. The steps from the floor to the
platform were occupied by men (whether peculiarly favoured
or not I don&rsquo;t know), but the seats behind Irving&rsquo;s chair are
evidently appropriated to the higher class of devotees, for
they were the best dressed of the congregation. The business
was conducted with decency, and the congregation was
attentive. It began with a hymn, the words given out by
one of the assistant preachers, and sung by the whole flock.
This, which seems to be common to all dissenting services, is
always very fine, the full swell of human voices producing a
grand effect. After this Irving delivered a prayer, in a very
slow drawling tone, rather long, and not at all striking in
point of language or thought. When he had finished, one
of the men sitting beside him arose, read a few verses from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE UNKNOWN TONGUES.</span>
the Bible, and discoursed thereon. He was a sorry fellow,
and was followed by two others, not much better. After
these three Spencer Perceval stood up. He recited the duty
to our neighbour in the catechism, and descanted on that
text in a style in all respects far superior to the others. He
appeared about to touch on politics, and (as well as I recollect)
was saying, &lsquo;Ye trusted that your institutions were
unalterable, ye believed that your loyalty to your King, your
respect for your nobility, your&rsquo;&mdash;when suddenly a low
moaning noise was heard, on which he instantly stopped,
threw his arm over his breast, and covered his eyes, in an
attitude of deep devotion, as if oppressed by the presence of
the spirit. The voice after ejaculating three &lsquo;Oh&rsquo;s,&rsquo; one
rising above the other, in tones very musical, burst into a
flow of unintelligible jargon, which, whether it was in English
or in gibberish I could not discover. This lasted five or six
minutes, and as the voice was silenced, another woman, in
more passionate and louder tones, took it up; this last spoke
in English, and words, though not sentences, were distinguishable.
I had a full view of her sitting exactly behind Irving&rsquo;s
chair. She was well dressed, spoke sitting, under great
apparent excitement, and screamed on till from exhaustion,
as it seemed, her voice gradually died away, and all was still.
Then Spencer Perceval, in slow and solemn tones, resumed,
not where he had left off, but with an exhortation to hear
the voice of the Lord which had just been uttered to the
congregation, and after a few more sentences he sat down.
Two more men followed him, and then Irving preached.
His subject was &lsquo;God&rsquo;s love,&rsquo; upon which he poured forth a
mystical incomprehensible rhapsody, with extraordinary vehemence
of manner and power of lungs. There was nothing
like eloquence in his sermon, no musical periods to captivate
the ear, no striking illustrations to charm the imagination;
but there is undoubtedly something in his commanding
figure and strange, wild countenance, his vehemence, and
above all the astonishing power of his voice, its compass, intonation,
and variety, which arrests attention, and gives the
notion of a great orator. I daresay he can speak well, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to waste real eloquence on such an auditory would be like
throwing pearls to swine. &lsquo;The bawl of Bellas&rsquo; is better
adapted for their ears than quiet sense in simpler sounds,
and the principle &lsquo;omne ignotum pro magnifico,&rsquo; can scarcely
find a happier illustration than amongst a congregation
whose admiration is probably in an inverse ratio to their
comprehension.</p>

<h3>December 6th, 1833</h3>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor, Parke, Bosanquet,
and Erskine met yesterday to consider a judgment, and took
three hours to manage it; business does not go on so quickly
with many Judges as with one, whether it be more satisfactory
or not. The Chancellor, the last time we met, announced
to the Bar (very oddly) that for the future their Lordships
would give judgment in turn. (He had himself delivered
the only judgment that had been given.) The Vice-Chancellor,
who I thought was his friend, laughed at this yesterday
with me, and said that he wanted to throw off from
himself as much as he could. I asked him (he had said
something, I forget what, about the Chancery Bill) what
would be left for the Chancellor to do when that Bill was
passed. He said, &lsquo;Nothing, that he meant to be Prime
Minister and Chancellor, and that it was what he had been
driving at all along, that the Bill for regulating the Privy
Council was only a part of his own plan, and that all his
schemes tended to that end.&rsquo; Setting political bias aside, it
is curious, considering his station, to hear the lawyers talk
of him, the contempt they universally have for him professionally,
how striking the contrast with the profound respect
which is paid to Lord Eldon. The other day, in the action
brought against the Chancellor for false imprisonment, Lord
Eldon was subp&oelig;naed, and he appeared to give evidence;
when he entered the Court, while he was examined, and
when he departed, the whole Bar stood up, and the Solicitor-General
<i>harangued</i> him, expressed in the name of his
brethren the satisfaction they felt at seeing him once more
among them. There is something affecting in these reverential
testimonials to a man from whom power has passed
away, and who is just descending into the grave, and I doubt

same.</p>

<h3>December 9th, 1833</h3>

<p>Went yesterday with Frederic Elliot and
Luttrell to hear Fox, a celebrated Unitarian preacher, at a
chapel in South Place, Finsbury Square. He is very short
and thick, dark hair, black eyes, and a countenance intelligent
though by no means handsome; his voice is not strong,
and his articulation imperfect, he cannot pronounce the s.
His sermon was, however, admirable, and amply repaid us
for the trouble of going so far. He read the whole of it,
the language was beautiful, the argument clear and unembarrassed,
the reasoning powerful, and there were occasionally
passages of great eloquence. The conclusion, which was a
sort of invocation to the Deity, was very fine. I like the
simplicity of the service: hymns, a prayer, and the sermon,
still I think a short liturgy preferable&mdash;our own, much abbreviated,
would be the best.</p>

<h3>December 13th, 1833</h3>

<p>Met Tavistock at dinner the other day,
and talked about the Government; from his intimacy with
Althorp and connection with the others he knows their
sentiments pretty accurately. He said that Lord Grey had
so high an opinion of Althorp that he made his remaining a
<i>sine quâ non</i>, and accordingly he does remain. He thought
Lord Grey would be glad to retire, but that he will go on as
long as he can, because the Government would be placed in
such great embarrassment by his retreat. He did not think
Brougham could succeed him, though he believed his popularity
in the country to be great; that all depended on the
part Peel took in the next session, for in the event of Lord
Grey&rsquo;s resignation he looked to the King&rsquo;s sending for Peel
to form a Government (much as Canning did when Lord
Liverpool died), principally composed of course of the <i>purest</i>
materials, but not exclusively, and that he did not think the
great body of the Liberal party would make any difficulty of
accepting office under Peel; that Stanley would not. He
(Tavistock) thinks that Peel could not come into office
<i>with</i> the Duke of Wellington; the Tories (Irvine, e.g.) think
he would not come in <i>without</i> him.</p>

<h3>December 18th, 1833</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Went with Moore yesterday morning to
the State Paper Office, and introduced him to
Lemon.<a name="FNA_22_04" id="FNA_22_04"></a><a href="#FN_22_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
It
was at the new office, where the documents are in course
of arrangement, and for the future they will be accessible and
useful. John Allen told Moore the other day that he considered
that the history of England had never really been written,
so much matter was there in public and private collections,
illustrative of it, that had never been made use of. Lemon
said he could in great measure confirm that assertion, as his
researches had afforded him the means of throwing great
light upon modern history, from the time of Henry VIII.
The fact is, that the whole thing is conventional; people take
the best evidence that has been produced, and give their
assent to a certain series of events, until more facts and
better evidence supplant the old statements and establish
others in their place. They are now printing Irish papers of
the time of Henry VIII., but from the folly of Henry Hobhouse,
who would not let the volume be indexed, it will be of little
service. In the evening dined with Moore at the Poodle&rsquo;s.
He told a good story of Sydney Smith and Leslie the Professor.
Leslie had written upon the North Pole; something
he had said had been attacked in the &lsquo;Edinburgh Review&rsquo;
in a way that displeased him. He called on Jeffrey just as
he was getting on horseback, and in a great hurry. Leslie
began with a grave complaint on the subject, which Jeffrey
interrupted with &lsquo;O damn the North Pole.&rsquo; Leslie went off
in high dudgeon, and soon after met Sydney, who, seeing him
disturbed, asked what was the matter. He told him what
he had been to Jeffrey about, and that he had in a very
unpleasant way said, &lsquo;Damn the North Pole.&rsquo; &lsquo;It was
very bad,&rsquo; said Sydney; &lsquo;but, do you know, I am not surprised
at it, for I have heard him speak very disrespectfully
of <i>the Equator</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>December 21st, 1833</h3>

<p>There is great talk of war with Russia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">HOSTILITY TO RUSSIA.</span>
which I don&rsquo;t believe will take place. I had a long talk with
Madame de Lieven the day before yesterday, and was surprised
to find her with such a lofty tone about war. She
said that it was &lsquo;<i>chance égale</i>;&rsquo; that they neither desired nor
feared it; that our tone had latterly been so insulting that
they had no option but that of replying with corresponding
hauteur; that if we sent ships to the Mediterranean they
would send ships: that if those measures were pursued, and
such language held, it was impossible to say that circumstances
might not bring about war, though equally against
the wishes and interests of all parties. In such a case we
might destroy their fleet and burn their harbours, but we
could not exclude them from Turkey, nor once established
there get them out again. That we must not fancy we
should be able, in conjunction with France, to keep the rest
of Europe in check; for it was the opinion of the wisest heads,
and of Louis Philippe himself, that a war would infallibly
bring about his downfall. (This latter opinion is likewise, I
find, that of the French ultra-Radicals; but they think the
war must be a war of opinion, and that the extreme Liberals,
who would thereby gain the ascendency, would make the
King the first victim.) She complained bitterly of the language
of our newspapers, and of our orators in Parliament,
described the indignation of the Russian Court, and the
dignified resentment mixed with contempt of the Emperor; in
short, talked very big, but still there will be no war.&mdash;I met
Dedel afterwards, and he told me that at Broadlands, where
they all met, some explanations in a tolerably friendly tone
did take place. The truth is that we have divested ourselves
of the right of objecting to Russia&rsquo;s measures with regard to
Turkey, although we do not dare acknowledge what we have
done, nor our motives. We were (and we are) in a false
position, and she has played her cards with great dexterity;
but the
Treaty<a name="FNA_22_05" id="FNA_22_05"></a><a href="#FN_22_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
is another thing, and is justly calculated to
excite our jealousy and suspicions. We have held this language
to Russia with regard to the Treaty: &lsquo;We do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
remonstrate, because we admit your right to make what
treaties you think fit; but we give you notice, that if any
attempt is made to enforce the stipulations of it against us,
we shall not endure it, and you must be prepared for the
consequences.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>1834.</h2>

<h3>Belvoir Castle, January 7th, 1834</h3>

<p>After many years of delay, I
am here since the 3rd, to assist at the celebration of the
Duke of Rutland&rsquo;s birthday. The party is very large, and
sufficiently dull: the Duke of Wellington, Esterhazy,
Matuscewitz, Rokeby, Miss d&rsquo;Este (afterwards Lady Truro),
and the rest a rabble of fine people, without beauty or wit
among them. The place is certainly very magnificent, and
the position of the castle unrivalled, though the interior is
full of enormous faults, which are wholly irretrievable. This
results from the management of the alterations having been
entrusted to the Duchess and Sir John Thurston (the former
of whom had some taste but no knowledge), and they have
consequently made a sad mess of it. There is immense
space wasted, and with great splendour and some comfort
the Castle has been tumbled about until they have contrived
to render it a very indifferent house; no two rooms communicating,
nor even (except the drawing-room and dining-room,
the former of which is seldom or never inhabited) contiguous.
The gallery, though unfinished, is a delightful apartment,
and one of the most comfortable I ever saw. The outside of
the Castle is faulty, but very grand; so grand as to sink criticism
in admiration; and altogether, with its terraces and
towers, its woods and hills, and its boundless prospect over
a rich and fertile country, it is a very noble possession. The
Duke lives here for three or four months, from the end of
October till the end of February or March, on and off, and
the establishment is kept up with extraordinary splendour.
In the morning we are roused by the strains of martial music,
and the band (of his regiment of militia) marches round the
terrace, awakening or quickening the guests with lively airs.
All the men hunt or shoot. At dinner there is a different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BELVOIR CASTLE.</span>
display of plate every day, and in the evening some play at
whist or amuse themselves as they please, and some walk
about the staircases and corridors to hear the band, which
plays the whole evening in the hall. On the Duke&rsquo;s birthday
there was a great feast in the Castle; 200 people dined in the
servants&rsquo; hall alone, without counting the other tables. We
were about forty at dinner. When the cloth was removed,
Esterhazy proposed His Grace&rsquo;s health, who has always a
speech prepared in which he returns thanks. This time it
was more simple than usual, and not at all bad. To-night
there is a ball for the servants, which could not take place
on the real birthday, as it fell on a Saturday.</p>

<p>I have had snatches of talk with the Duke of Wellington,
and yesterday morning he retired with Matuscewitz, and had
a long conference with him. The absolute Courts have a
great hankering after the Duke, though their Ministers here
can hardly look for his return to office; nor do I believe that
if he was to come back he would be found indulgent to the
projects of Russia, though he might be disinclined to continue
so very intimate as we now are with France. He told me
this morning he thought the French King&rsquo;s speech to his
Chambers exceedingly good. He of course disapproves of
all our foreign policy, particularly in the Peninsula. He says
he sees no daylight whatever through the Portuguese affair.
The Spanish may terminate in the success of the Queen, but
only by her opposing Liberalism. He is convinced that if
she introduces Liberal principles she will be lost. He says
that the Spanish Government will be too happy to interfere
in the Portuguese contest (as in fact I know that they have
offered to do), but that we never can allow this, which besides
the consequences of interference (as a principle) would necessarily
make Portugal dependent on Spain. Arbuthnot, who
is here, told me (and he hears these things from the Duke)
that Matuscewitz had expressed the greatest contempt for
Palmerston, and not the less for Lord Grey; and that, with
regard to the latter, he had been much struck with his ignorance.
I do not know on what points he meant, but it must
be in history or diplomacy, which I am surprised at, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I thought he was a man of a cultivated mind and general
information, who would be found, as far as knowledge goes,
competent to any discussion. He likewise said that he found
him slow of comprehension.</p>

<h3>Belvoir, January 8th, 1834</h3>

<p>There was a ball for all the servants
and tenants on Monday, which the Duke of Rutland
opened with Lady Georgina Fane, and the Duke of Wellington
followed with Lady Brownlow. Yesterday half the
people went to Belton; it was nearly impossible to get any
talk with the Duke. He told me that the Russians were in
no hurry to do any overt act in Turkey, and that their policy
was as it had always been&mdash;to work very gradually. I asked
him if he thought they really intended a permanent occupation
of Turkey. He said certainly not; that they could
not bear the expense of a war, which in that case would
ensue; that the difference of the expense between their own
and a foreign country was as between 10<i>d</i>. and 4<i>s</i>. a man.</p>

<p>To-day I have been all over this Castle; the arrangements
are admirable, and the order and cleanliness of every part of
the offices and the magnitude of the establishment are very
remarkable, and such as I have never seen elsewhere. This
afternoon Gosh [Mr. Arbuthnot] came and sat with me, and
talked over all matters, which I have heard from him before,
though he has forgotten it, which he well may, for his
intellect, never very bright, seems to be almost entirely
obscured. I daresay I have put down these things before,
but as they are curious scraps of history they may as well
go down again. It all relates to the break-up of Lord Grey&rsquo;s
Government in &rsquo;32, and the abortive attempts of the Duke
to form an administration.</p>

<p>The King had given his word that he had never promised
to make a single peer. Doubts arose whether he had not told
a lie; they pressed him on this point (Wellington and Lyndhurst);
he persisted in his denial, upon which they requested
Taylor might be sent for, and all the correspondence produced,
when they found he was pledged up to the throat,
and without reserve. The King then attempted to get out
of it by saying he had consented to call up the sons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND MR. PEEL.</span>
Scotch peers and give to Irish peers English peerages, which
he did not consider a creation of peers!</p>

<p>When the Duke accepted the commission to form a
Government, it was resolved to prorogue Parliament, and
Lyndhurst was desired by the King to go to Lord Grey and
tell him such was his pleasure. Lyndhurst forgot it! In
after times, those who write the history of these days will
probably discuss the conduct of the great actors, and it will
not fail to be matter of surprise that such an obvious expedient
was not resorted to, in order to suspend violent discussions.
Among the various reasons that will be imagined and
suggested, I doubt if it will occur to anybody that the real
reason was that it was <i>forgotten</i>.</p>

<p>Arbuthnot says they know that Lyndhurst was intriguing
with the Whigs when the Duke was turned out in &rsquo;30, and
that it had been settled that he was to remain their Chancellor;
and so he would have been if Brougham would have
consented to be Attorney-General, and had not run restive,
and given clear indications of his resolution to destroy the
Government if he was left out of it. He says that notwithstanding
the duplicity of Peel&rsquo;s conduct in 1832, he and the
Duke are always on good terms, and no great question is
ever agitated without Peel&rsquo;s coming to the Duke and talking
it over with him; that Peel is determined to have nothing
to do with the Whigs, and told him (Arbuthnot) so very
lately, but the High Tories are just as unmanageable as
ever. Chandos came to the Duke the other day, and told
him he thought they ought to get up petitions against the
malt tax. The Duke said he would countenance no such
thing; that he thought the revenue of the country should
be supported; for if it failed, recourse must be had to a
property tax, which would fall on the aristocracy; and so he
persuaded him to let the malt tax alone.</p>

<h3>January 26th, 1834</h3>

<p>I left Belvoir on Friday, the 10th, and
went to Mrs. Arkwright&rsquo;s,<a name="FNA_22_06" id="FNA_22_06"></a><a href="#FN_22_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
at Stoke, where I found nobody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but her own family. I was well enough amused for two
days with her original conversation and her singing, and her
cousin, Miss Twiss, who, with a face of uncommon plainness
and the voice of a man, is sensible and well informed. Then
they both liked to have me, and that is a great charm; a
little agreeableness goes a great way in the Peak, and it is
not difficult to procure a triumph to one&rsquo;s vanity from people
who, with a good deal of power of appreciation, have very
little opportunity for comparison, and are therefore easily
satisfied. Arkwright told me that it was reported by those
who were better informed than himself of his father&rsquo;s circumstances,
that he is worth from seven to eight millions.
His grandfather began life as a barber, invented some
machinery, got a patent, and made a fortune. His son gave
him offence by a marriage which he disapproved of, and he
quarrelled with him, but gave him a mill. Arkwright, the
son, saw nothing of his father for many years, but by industry
and ability accumulated great wealth. When Sir
Richard served as Sheriff, his son thought it right to go out
with the other gentlemen of the county to meet him, and
the old gentleman was struck with his handsome equipage,
and asked to whom it belonged. Upon being informed, he
sought a reconciliation with him, and was astonished to find
that his son was as rich as himself. From that time they
continued on good terms, and at his death he bequeathed
him the bulk of his property.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_22_06" id="FN_22_06"></a><a href="#FNA_22_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[Mrs. Arkwright was a Kemble by birth, and had much of the musical
and dramatic genius of that gifted family. Her singing was most touching,
and some of her musical compositions were full of originality and expression.]</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Arkwright told me the curious story of Sir Thomas
Lawrence&rsquo;s engagements with her two cousins, the daughters
of Mrs. Siddons. They were two sisters, one tall and very
handsome, the other little, without remarkable beauty, but
very clever and agreeable. He fell in love with the first,
and they were engaged to be married. Of course under such
circumstances he lived constantly and freely in the house,
and after some time the superior intelligence of the clever
sister changed the current of his passion, and she supplanted
the handsome one in the affection of the artist. They concealed
the double treachery, but one day a note which was
intended for his new love fell into the hands of the old love,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A MURDER NEAR RUNTON.</span>
who, never doubting it was for herself, opened it, and discovered
the fatal truth. From that time she drooped,
sickened, and shortly after died. On her deathbed she
exacted a promise from her sister that she would never marry
Lawrence, who firmly adhered to it. He continued his
relations with her with more or less intimacy up to the
period of her death, the date of which I do not recollect.</p>

<p>From Stoke I went on Monday, 13th, to Drakelow, which
Sir Roger Gresley has lent to Craufurd, and stayed there two
nights. It is a miserable place, with the Trent running
under the windows, and Lord Anglesey&rsquo;s land close to the
door. Thence on Wednesday to Runton Abbey&mdash;Lord
Lichfield&rsquo;s&mdash;who has added to it a farm-house, and made a
residence in the midst of his property, where he has the
best shooting in England. He and I went out the day after
I got there, and killed 41 pheasants, 74 hares, 24 rabbits,
8 woodcocks, and 8 partridges. He is a fine fellow, with an
excellent disposition, liberal, hospitable, frank and gay,
quick and intelligent, without cultivation, extravagant and
imprudent, with considerable aptitude for business; between
spending and speculating, buying property in one place,
selling in another, and declining to sell in a third, he has
half ruined a noble estate.</p>

<p>Just before I got there a murder had been committed
close to his house under very curious circumstances, of which
some notice appeared in the newspapers. A soldier in the
Artillery got a legacy of 500&#8467;., with which he bought his
discharge, went down to the village near Runton, and took
a very pretty girl of indifferent character to live with him.
He gave her shawls and trinkets, and spent a good deal of
money on her. Having addicted himself immoderately to
drink, he soon spent all his money, and, to supply himself
with the means of getting drunk, he began robbing his mistress
of the articles he had given her. It happened that
about this time somebody in the village who had been robbed
consulted a cunning man of great repute in the neighbourhood,
and so alarmed was the thief at the bare idea of what
this oracle might utter, that the stolen property was secretly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
restored. The girl upon hearing of this restitution resolved
to have recourse to the cunning man, and invited her lover
to escort her to his abode. After endeavouring in vain to
dissuade her they set out together, but he was so overcome
with terror as he went along that he stopped short in the
road and refused to proceed. On this the girl said that it
was easy to see who was the thief, and that the reason he
would not face the conjuror was that he was conscious of his
own guilt. Upon this they fell to high words, then to blows,
and he finished by murdering her. He did not attempt to
escape, but repaired to a public-house, where he was soon
after taken into custody. He acknowledged the crime, and
said he was weary of life, and deserved to be hanged. Here
is an example of the miserable effects of good fortune upon
a man who was unfit to use it, and of the strange superstition
of the common people. The murderer will be tried at the
next assizes.</p>

<p>I stayed at Runton till Sunday, 19th, when I came
here,<a name="FNA_22_07" id="FNA_22_07"></a><a href="#FN_22_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
where there was nobody but the family and Ralph Sneyd.
The place is exceedingly beautiful, and arranged with excellent
taste. It has been very agreeable. Lady Harrowby is
superior to all the women I have ever known; &lsquo;her talk is
so crisp,&rsquo; as Luttrell once said of her. She has no imagination,
no invention, no eloquence, no deep reading or retentive
memory, but a noble, straightforward, independent
character, a sound and vigorous understanding, penetration,
judgment, taste. She is perfectly natural, open and sincere,
loves conversation and social enjoyment; with her intimate
friends there is an <i>abandon</i> and unreserved communion of
thoughts, feelings, and opinions which renders her society
delightful. Of all the women I ever saw she unites the
most masculine mind with the most feminine heart. Lord
Harrowby<a name="FNA_22_08" id="FNA_22_08"></a><a href="#FN_22_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
has all the requisites of disagreeableness, a tart,
short, provoking manner, with manners at once pert and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF LORD HARROWBY.</span>
rigid; but he is full of information, and if made the best of
may yield a good deal of desirable knowledge. Though not
illiberal in politics, he has fallen into the high Tory despondency
about the prospects of the country, and anticipates
every evil that the most timid alarmist can suggest. Still,
justice should be rendered to Lord Harrowby; a purer and
more disinterested statesman never existed. He was always
devoid of selfishness and ambition, honourable and conscientious
to a degree which rendered him incapable of a sordid
or oblique action. Always acute, but sometimes crotchety,
he had the same fault in politics which was the reproach of
Lord Eldon in law&mdash;indecision; and this in no small degree
impaired both his efficacy and his authority. His great idol
was Pitt, and, after him, he was the friend and admirer of
Perceval. Bred in their school, and a Tory by taste, by
habit, and in opinion, it is not a little to his honour that he
was able to comprehend the mighty changes which time and
circumstances had effected, and to perceive that an inflexible
adherence to high Tory maxims was dangerous, because
their practical operation was no longer possible; but justice
must be rendered to him hereafter, for he will never obtain
it in his own time. By endeavouring to steer between two
great and exasperated factions he became thoroughly obnoxious
to both. After having refused the post of Prime
Minister, no one can doubt the sincerity of his desire to
retire from public life, and in the consciousness of rectitude,
the disgust of parties, and a calm and dignified philosophy,
he finds ample consolation for all the obloquy with which he
has been assailed.</p>

<h3>Burghley, January 28th, 1834</h3>

<p>Came here yesterday, and found
Lady Clinton, Lady Frederic Bentinck, Lyne Stephens and
Irby, not amusing. Captain Spencer came to-day. I had
almost forgotten the house, which is surprisingly grand in
all respects, though the living rooms are not numerous or
handsome enough. I just missed Peel, who went to Belvoir
yesterday. I heard wonderful things of railroads and steam
when I was in Staffordshire, yet by the time anybody reads
what I now write (if anybody ever does), how they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
smile perhaps at what I gape and stare at, and call wonderful,
with such accelerated velocity do we move on. Stephenson,
the great engineer, told Lichfield that he had travelled on
the Manchester and Liverpool railroad for many miles at the
rate of a mile a minute, that his doubt was not how fast his
engines could be made to go, but at what pace it would be
proper to stop, that he could make them travel with greater
speed than any bird can cleave the air, and that he had
ascertained that 400 miles an hour was the extreme velocity
which the human frame could endure, at which it could
move and exist.</p>

<h3>February 1st, 1834</h3>

<p>Lord Wharncliffe has been here and is
gone. He, like Harrowby, is very dismal about the prospects
of the country, and thinks we are gravitating towards a
revolution. He says that the constituency of the great
towns is composed of ultra-Radicals, and that no gentleman
with really independent and conservative principles can sit
for them, that the great majority of the manufacturers and
of the respectable persons of the middle class are moderate,
and hostile to subversion and violent measures, but that their
influence is overwhelmed by the numerical strength of the
low voters, who want to go all lengths. He says that he
has received greater marks of deference and respect in his
own county, and especially at Sheffield, where a short time
ago he would have been in danger of being torn in pieces,
than he ever experienced, but that he could no more bring a
son in for Sheffield than he could fly in the air. Sir John
Beckett is just gone to stand for Leeds, and certainly the
catechism to which he was there forced to submit is very
ominous. A seat in the House of Commons will cease to be
an object of ambition to honourable and independent men,
if it can only be obtained by cringing and servility to the
rabble of great towns, and when it shall be established that
the member is to be a slave, bound hand and foot by pledges,
and responsible for every vote he gives to masters who are
equally tyrannical and unreasonable. I know nothing more
difficult than to form a satisfactory opinion upon the real
state and prospects of the country amidst the conflicting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STATE OF SPAIN.</span>
prejudices and impressions of individuals of different parties
and persuasions, and there are so many circumstances that
tell different ways, that at this moment my judgment is
entirely suspended on the subject.</p>

<p>George Villiers gave a deplorable account of the state of
Spain, but he (unlike the Duke of Wellington) thinks that
the only chance of safety for the Queen is to make common
cause with the Liberals. He has been greatly instrumental
to Zea&rsquo;s removal, having conveyed to the Queen Regent that
England by no means considered his continuance in the
Ministry indispensable, and this intimation, together with the
storm which assailed him from all parts, determined her to
dismiss him. Palmerston has never written to George
Villiers once since <i>October</i>. I heard the same thing of him
in some other case, I forget which.</p>

<h3>February 6th, 1834</h3>

<p>Returned to town yesterday from Newmarket,
which I took in my way from Burghley. Parliament
had opened the day before, with a long <i>nothingy</i> (a
word I have coined) speech from the throne, in which the
most remarkable points were a violent declaration against
O&rsquo;Connell, that is, against Irish agitation, and strong expressions
of amity with France. It is comical to compare
the language of the very silly old gentleman who wears the
crown, in his convivial moments, and in the openness of his
heart, with that which his Ministers cram into his mouth,
each sentiment being uttered with equal energy and apparent
sincerity. Lord Grey is said to have made a very good
speech on the Address. The House of Commons has commenced
with all the dulness imaginable, but it was enlivened
last night by a squabble on the Hill and Sheil
business<a name="FNA_22_09" id="FNA_22_09"></a><a href="#FN_22_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
(dragged on by O&rsquo;Connell), and the ultimate arrest of Althorp
and Sheil by the Serjeant-at-arms, a very foolish affair,
which must end as it began, in much declaiming and swearing,
and no positive conviction, though complete moral
certitude. It afforded much amusement, as everything
personal does. The present expectation is that the session
will go off rather quietly.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_22_09" id="FN_22_09"></a><a href="#FNA_22_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[Mr. Hill, a member of Parliament, had stated in a speech that some
of the Irish members most vehemently opposed to the Coercion Bill in the
House of Commons had nevertheless privately stated to members of the
Government that they were glad the Act should be renewed. This charge
was denied with great heat by the Irish members in the House when Parliament
met. But upon Mr. Sheil&rsquo;s calling upon Lord Althorp to state
whether he was one of the members alluded to, Lord Althorp replied that
the honourable gentleman was one of them. Sheil immediately denied it
in the most solemn and emphatic terms; and as it was feared that a hostile
meeting might ensue between him and Lord Althorp, they were both taken
into custody by the Serjeant-at-arms. Further explanations ensued, and
Lord Althorp subsequently withdrew the charge, stating that he believed
Mr. Sheil&rsquo;s asseveration, and that he must himself have been misinformed.]</p></div>

<h3>February 13th, 1834</h3>

<p>It is observed by everybody that there
never was a session of Parliament which opened with such
an appearance of apathy as this. After the violent excitement
which has almost incessantly prevailed for the last two
years or more, men&rsquo;s minds seem exhausted, and though the
undergrowl of political rancour is still heard, and a feeble
cry of the Church is in danger, on the whole there is less
bitterness and animosity, and a tolerably fair promise that
things will go on in a smooth and even course. The storm
that impended over Europe has blown off, and there seems
to be no danger of any interruption of the peace. Esterhazy
and Madame de Lieven both told me last night that they
thought so now, and the former that he had told Palmerston
that we might rely upon Austria&rsquo;s not being an indifferent
spectator of the political conduct of Russia, and if we would
place confidence in them, they would not only prevent any
dangerous aggression on the part of Russia in Europe, but
would take such measures as should contribute largely to the
security of our Eastern dominions, though that was no object
of immediate interest to them. Madame de Lieven told me
that it was impossible to describe the contempt as well as
dislike which the whole corps diplomatique had for Palmerston,
and pointing to Talleyrand, who was sitting close by,
&lsquo;surtout lui.&rsquo; They have the meanest opinion of his capacity,
and his manners are the reverse of conciliatory. She cannot
imagine how his colleagues bear with him, and Lord Grey
supports him vehemently. The only <i>friend</i> he has in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">UNPOPULARITY OF LORD PALMERSTON.</span>
cabinet is Graham, who has no weight. His unpopularity
in his own office is quite as great as it is among the foreign
ministers, and he does nothing, so that they do not make up
in respect for what they want in inclination. George Villiers
complains that for above three months he has not received a
single line from him, and he is a young minister, unpractised
in the profession, to whom is committed the most delicate
and difficult mission in Europe. He spends his time in
making love to Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash; whom he takes to the House of
Commons to hear speeches which he does not make, and
where he exhibits his conquest, and certainly it is the best
of his exploits, but what a successor of Canning, whom by
the way he affects to imitate. What would be Canning&rsquo;s
indignation if he could look from his grave and see these
new Reformers, who ape him in his worst qualities, and who
blunder and bluster in the seat which he once filled with
such glory and success. It must be owned that we are in a
curious condition, and if the character of the Government,
moral and intellectual, be analysed, it will exhibit a very
astonishing result: with a great deal of loose talent of one
sort or another scattered about it, but mixed with so much
alloy, that, compounded as it is, the metal seems very base.
However, we are not likely to get anything better, and these
people will very likely hammer on tolerably well.</p>

<p>Since Parliament met, the foolish business of Sheil and
Hill has been the sole topic of discussion, to the unspeakable
disgust of every sensible person in and out of the House.
All feel the embarrassment, the ridicule, the disgrace of such
an occupation, and the members of Parliament are provoked
that the affair was not strangled at the outset. The Speaker
is now generally blamed for not having prevented Althorp
from answering O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s question, which he ought to have
done, at least ought to have warned the House of the consequences,
when undoubtedly the matter would have been
stifled. They say Althorp did what he had to do very well,
like a gentleman and man of honour, and in excellent style
and taste, though many think he need not have said so much.
The committee began to sit yesterday; it was not a secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
committee, but they agreed to request members not to come
in; however, the tail would go in, and they found it would
be a difficult matter to exclude them, for which reason, and
because Sheil had no friend on the committee, they unanimously
agreed that the House should be invited to add
O&rsquo;Connell to it, and after some difficulty raised by John
Russell, this was consented to.</p>

<h3>February 14th, 1834</h3>

<p>Last night at Miss Berry&rsquo;s met Mrs.
Somerville, the great mathematician. I had been reading
in the morning Sedgwick&rsquo;s sermon on education, in which
he talks of Whewell, Airy, and Mrs. Somerville, mentioning
her as one of the great luminaries of the present day.
The subject of astronomy is so sublime that one shrinks into
a sense of nothingness in contemplating it, and can&rsquo;t help
regarding those who have mastered the mighty process and
advanced the limits of the science as beings of another order.
I could not then take my eyes off this woman, with a feeling
of surprise and something like incredulity, all involuntary
and very foolish; but to see a mincing, smirking person, fan
in hand, gliding about the room, talking nothings and nonsense,
and to know that La Place was her plaything and
Newton her acquaintance, was too striking a contrast not to
torment the brain. It was Newton&rsquo;s mantle trimmed and
flounced by Maradan.</p>

<h3>February 17th, 1834</h3>

<p>In the House of Commons the Sheil
committee came to a sudden termination. It was a silly
and discreditable business, and people were glad it ended.
The course adopted was this: they took the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo;
newspaper, containing the paragraph inculpatory of Sheil,
and they called on Hill to prove his case. Hill called witnesses,
one of whom, Macaulay, refused to speak. He said
he would not repeat what had passed in private conversation.
The committee approved, and Hill threw up his case, held
out his hand &lsquo;with strong emotion&rsquo; to Sheil, made ample
apologies, and Sheil was acquitted. Then came the apologies
in the House of Commons. Peel told me that he was convinced
Sheil really had never said what was imputed to him;
but that he said something tantamount, though very loosely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">O&rsquo;CONNELL&rsquo;S ATTACK ON BARON SMITH.</span>
is probable, and the people who had told Althorp would not
come forward to bear him out, so that he was forced to
apologise too, but he did it very reluctantly. The Irishmen,
however, had not done, and O&rsquo;Dwyer (formerly a reporter)
attacked Pease, asked for explanations, his card and address.
Pease, who is a Quaker, said &lsquo;he gave no explanations but
on his legs in the House of Commons, had no card and no
address.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But there was a more serious matter than Sheil and Hill&rsquo;s
trash&mdash;O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s attack upon Baron Smith, the circumstances
of which exemplify the way the House of Commons
is managed under Althorp&rsquo;s auspices, and the general mode
of proceeding of the Government there. O&rsquo;Connell gave
notice of a motion for an address to the Crown to remove
the Baron. Government resolved to oppose it. Littleton
authorised Shaw to write to him and say so, and that he
would say nothing in the debate offensive to him, though he
could not but disapprove of his charge. Nobody thought of
any support the motion would receive beyond that of the tail.
The Ministers came down to the House in this mind. Stanley
and Graham went away for some purpose or other, and when
they came back they found that O&rsquo;Connell had altered the
terms of his motion, and that Althorp, Littleton, and the
Solicitor-General had agreed to support it; in short, that
O&rsquo;Connell had laid a trap for them, and they had gone ding-dong
into it. Stanley was very angry and much annoyed,
but the thing being done he knocked under, and tried to
bolster up the business. Graham would not, and in a
maudlin, stupid sort of speech declared his opposition, which
was honest enough. All this annoyed the Government very
much, and now O&rsquo;Connell is said to be quite satisfied with
what he has done, and does not want to have a committee,
but (having thrown a slur on the Judge by the vote of
Parliament) to let the matter drop. Spring Rice also voted
against the Government, and said that he had never known a
worse case since he sat in Parliament, and that nothing
could be more mischievous than the effect such a vote
would produce in Ireland. Scarlett, Peel, and Spankie made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
very good speeches; Stanley, John Russell, and Campbell
as bad.</p>

<p>The same night Althorp made his financial statement,
exhibiting a surplus revenue and reduction of taxation, all
very flourishing and promising; but in announcing his intended
reduction of the House Tax, he said without any
disguise that he did not think it an objectionable tax, but
that he took it off on account of the clamour against it.
Here are three exhibitions in one week, and this is the
Minister of our finances and organ of Government in the
House of Commons. No matter how he blunders in word or
deed, he smiles in dogged good-humour at ridicule or abuse;
his intentions are good, his mind is straightforward, and his
conscious rectitude, his personal popularity, enable him to
commit his blunders with impunity; but the authority of
Government suffers in his hands; maxims get into vogue
which are incompatible with good and strong government,
and the effects of his weakness and facility may be felt long
after the cessation of their immediate operation.</p>

<h3>February 19th, 1834</h3>

<p>Last night Whittle Harvey&rsquo;s motion on
the Pension List. He made admirable speeches; but had a
majority of nine against him. This division is not a bad exemplification
of the state of parties and of the House of Commons.
Some of the Tories voted (in the majority of course),
many others would not. I asked one of them (Henry Hope, a
man of no consequence, certainly) if he was not going to vote.
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I shall not vote, the Government must manage
their own business as they can.&rsquo; He would not vote against
a proposition he must regard with the greatest aversion,
because he would thereby be supporting the Government
and prefers the chance of giving a victory to the Radicals,
establishing a dangerous principle, and doing a great injury
to a host of individuals, the greater part of whom are of his
own party or among his own friends, because he thinks that
the result may be productive of some embarrassment to
Ministers. This is one of the cases in which the conduct of
Government has been such as their bitterest enemies must
applaud, when they risk their popularity to support a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STATE OF THE TORY PARTY.</span>
unsightly list of pensions, not granted by themselves, or to
their friends, from a sense of justice; and yet these high
Tories will not support them even in fighting such a battle
as this. On the other hand, the Government reject their
support when they might avail themselves of it against the
Radicals and ultra-Whigs, in such a case as that of Baron
Smith the other night; and so ill blood is constantly increasing
between them, while O&rsquo;Connell and his tail and the
Radical blackguards sit by and chuckle at the evils these
mutual jealousies and antipathies produce. Richmond told
me yesterday that Stanley was greatly annoyed at Baron
Smith&rsquo;s affair; but finding the mischief done, and feeling
the embarrassment that would arise from his opposing
Althorp, he threw himself into the breach; said he had advised
him never to do so again. The conduct of Althorp,
Littleton, and Campbell is inconceivable, unless it were to
give a fresh triumph to O&rsquo;Connell (he has just carried
Dungarvan, Jacob <i>v.</i> Barron; &lsquo;it is the voice of <i>Jacob</i> but
the hand of <i>Esau</i>&rsquo;), who has had his own way hitherto in
this Parliament. In this business and in Sheil&rsquo;s he has done
just what he pleased, and made the Government appear in
as pitiful a light as he could possibly desire. O&rsquo;Dwyer told the
Speaker that O&rsquo;Connell had never expected <i>or even wished</i> that
Ministers should give way to him to the extent they did.</p>

<p>Knatchbull has given notice of a motion to reverse the
decision for a committee on the case of Baron Smith,
and in conjunction with Peel. It must embarrass the
Government, but it is not, I think, judicious, because it
is not the same question, and affords them the opportunity
of treating it on different grounds. In the division
last night the three Lennox&rsquo;s all voted with the minority,
brothers of a Cabinet Minister, and all their sisters
being on the Pension List. Molyneux was going out, and
was forcibly retained by Stanley. It looks as if the whipping
in was very unskilfully managed. Notwithstanding
the present prosperity and tranquillity, it is impossible not
to be disturbed at the mode in which business is conducted
in the House of Commons, and at the state and animus of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
parties, and above all at Althorp being the leader there.
His character is peculiarly fitted to do mischief in these
times, and his virtues are unfortunate, for they serve to
bolster him up, and to keep him where he is in spite of his
blunders. His temper is so admirable, his personal popularity
so great, that there is an impression that the House
will be led by him more easily than by Stanley, who alone,
of the present Government, could aspire to that post. Nobody
imputes to Althorp a spark of ambition, and ample
credit is given him for the most disinterested motives, and
for making a great personal sacrifice in retaining his present
situation. The consciousness of this makes him comparatively
indifferent to victory or defeat, and careless of that nice
management which formerly was indispensable in a leader.
He seems totally blind to the consequences of his errors, and
the advantage that is taken of them by those who not only
meditate mischief to the Administration, but to the great
interests they are bound to protect. Occurrences and circumstances
that would have filled former leaders with vexation,
and their followers with dismay, seem to pass over
him without ruffling his serenity or alarming his mind.
He acts as if in utter unconsciousness of a restless spirit of
popular aggrandisement, as if the House of Commons was
an innoxious and manageable machine, as if it was sufficient
to mean well, and he lets matters take their chance, without
any of that vigilant and systematic direction which, if
guided by a nice discrimination, might regulate the movements
and check the eccentricities of this vast and unruly
body. Since the opening of this session, all that he has said
and done has proved his utter unfitness for the place he
occupies. First, his imprudent answers to O&rsquo;Connell, and
the turn he gave to that affair. Then, in bringing forward
his financial statement, the naïveté with which he admitted
that he had submitted to the clamour against the House Tax,
and withdrawn it contrary to his own judgment; then the
facility with which he gave in to O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s motion about
the Irish Judge, and threw over his colleagues and his
party without an apparent reason or motive. It produces a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD ALTHORP&rsquo;S DEFECTS AS LEADER.</span>
feeling allied to despair, all security is at an end, for that
which would be produced by his good intentions is destroyed
by reflecting on his miserable judgment; half republican
in his principles, and incredulous of any danger to
be apprehended from the continual increase of popular influences
in the House of Commons, he does not perceive
how much the authority of a leader is diminished in his
hands, and how difficult it will be for any successor of his to
gain that sort of ascendency which is indispensable for the
effective conduct of public business, and the moral character
of the Government. To effect this, besides great talents,
great tact, discretion, sagacity, and temper will be required;
more, I fear, than fall to the share of Stanley, who is better
qualified to be a debater than a leader. Moderate men, who do
not approve of this Government, but who do not desire to turn
them out, if they would only act upon tolerably conservative
principles, are thrown into despair by the behaviour of
Althorp, and regard with consternation the inevitable
increase of anarchy in the House of Commons, and consequent
prevalence of Radical principles, from the sluggish,
inert, vacillating, unforeseeing character he
displays.<a name="FNA_22_10" id="FNA_22_10"></a><a href="#FN_22_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_22_10" id="FN_22_10"></a><a href="#FNA_22_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[These remarks made at the time are not altogether just to Lord
Althorp, and it is now well known from other sources, equally authentic,
that he was more conscious than anyone else was of his own shortcomings,
and passionately desirous to be released from office. But it was notorious
that the retirement of Lord Althorp from the leadership of the House of
Commons would be the signal for the dissolution of Earl Grey&rsquo;s Government,
and so within a few months the result proved.]</p></div>

<h3>February 22nd, 1834</h3>

<p>Went to the House of Commons last
night, where I have not been for many years. A great
change, and hardly a human being whose face I knew. I
heard the end of the debate on Chandos&rsquo; motion, when Peel
gave O&rsquo;Connell a severe dressing, and I heard the debate on
rescinding the order for a committee on Baron Smith. Shaw,
who held the Baron&rsquo;s brief, made a very fine speech, but
afforded a memorable example of the danger of saying too
much, and of the importance of knowing when to stop. Not
contented with a very powerful and eloquent appeal, which
he wound up with an energetic peroration, he suffered himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to be led away into a tirade about O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s enmity to
religion, and instead of ending as he might have done
with shouts of applause, was coughed and &lsquo;questioned&rsquo; to
the close. Stanley made a wretched speech; O&rsquo;Connell
very bad, affecting to be moderate, he was only dull. Peel
spoke very shortly, but very well indeed. Peel&rsquo;s is an
enviable position; in the prime of life, with an immense
fortune, <i>facile princeps</i> in the House of Commons, unshackled
by party connections and prejudices, universally regarded as
the ablest man, and with (on the whole) a very high character,
free from the cares of office, able to devote himself to
literature, to politics, or idleness, as the fancy takes him.
No matter how unruly the House, how impatient or fatigued,
the moment he rises all is silence, and he is sure of being
heard with profound attention and respect. This is the enjoyable
period of his life, and he must make the most of it,
for when time and the hour shall bring about his return to
power, his cares and anxieties will begin, and with whatever
success his ambition may hereafter be crowned, he will
hardly fail to look back with regret to this holiday time of
his political career. How free and light he must feel at
being liberated from the shackles of his old connections, and
at being able to take any part that his sense of his own
interests or of the public exigencies may point out! And
then the satisfactory consciousness of being by far the most
eminent man in the House of Commons, to see and feel the
respect he inspires and the consideration he enjoys. It is a
melancholy proof of the decadence of ability and eloquence in
that House, when Peel is the first, and, except Stanley, almost
the only real orator in it. He speaks with great energy,
great dexterity&mdash;his language is powerful and easy; he
reasons well, hits hard, and replies with remarkable promptitude
and effect; but he is at an immense distance below the
great models of eloquence, Pitt, Fox, and Canning; his voice
is not melodious, and it is a little monotonous; his action is
very ungraceful, his person and manner are vulgar, and he
has certain tricks in his motions which exhibit that vulgarity
in a manner almost offensive, and which is only redeemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR ROBERT PEEL&rsquo;S FUTURE.</span>
by the real power of his speeches. His great merit consists
in his judgment, tact and discretion, his facility, promptitude,
thorough knowledge of the assembly he addresses,
familiarity with the details of every sort of Parliamentary
business, and the great command he has over himself.
He never was a great favourite of mine, but I am satisfied
that he is the fittest man to be Minister, and I therefore
wish to see him return to power. Stanley told me yesterday
how very glad they were at having been defeated on Baron
Smith&rsquo;s case, and that they were thereby relieved from a
great embarrassment. Times are mightily altered, when
such defeats and such scrapes produce no effect upon
Government, and when they can go on upon two majorities
of 4 and 8 and one defeat.</p>

<h3>February 25th, 1834</h3>

<p>There has been a meeting at Althorp&rsquo;s
to-day, numerously attended, in which he talked with some
effect as it is said, the audience having gone away in a
humour to support Government. He took occasion, on
somebody hinting at the disunion among themselves, to say
that though there might exist differences of opinion on some
minor points, he believed there never had existed a Cabinet
of which the members were more firmly knit together by
private friendship and political concurrence.</p>

<p>It was Methuen who harangued, and who said that the
meeting was very unsatisfactory. Althorp began by saying
that unless gentlemen would more regularly and consistently
support the Government it could not be carried on, when
Paul<a name="FNA_22_11" id="FNA_22_11"></a><a href="#FN_22_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
rejoined that the Government did not support itself,
and that they seemed divided. Moreover, that when the
Chancellor of the Exchequer himself talked with so much
doubt and uncertainty about reducing particular taxes, he
must not be surprised if everybody tried to get what they
could for themselves in the general scramble.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_22_11" id="FN_22_11"></a><a href="#FNA_22_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>

<p>There are letters from George Villiers to-day (not to me,
but to his mother), in which he gives a deplorable account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Spain, that Carlos has a large party in the north, where the
Queen&rsquo;s person is odious, the monks have persuaded the
people that she is atheistical and republican, that she has
not force enough to crush the rebellion, and what she has is
scattered on different points, without being able to make any
combined or vigorous efforts, that she has no money. The
Cortes is to be assembled, but they (I suppose the Ministers)
have rejected all good advice on this subject, and nobody can
anticipate the effect that will be produced by 300 or 400
individuals meeting in a legislative capacity. If Miguel had
resolved to give effectual aid to Carlos, and dashed into
Spain, he might certainly have placed him on the throne,
and then secured him as a powerful ally to himself in his
own contest. Miguel&rsquo;s own case he (George Villiers) by no
means considers hopeless, thinks him much better off than
Pedro was when at Oporto. The stories of the
Queen&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_22_12" id="FNA_22_12"></a><a href="#FN_22_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
gallantries are true. He does not say so <i>totidem verbis</i>,
because he does not dare, but he manages to convey as
much in answer to a question his mother asked him. He
thinks that the great probability is that universal anarchy
will convulse that country with civil war of the most destructive
character, and that the provinces, kingdoms, and
districts will be arrayed against each other. The Carlists
of Spain being in the north, and those of France in the
south, it is very likely they will endeavour to make common
cause, in which case it will be difficult for France not to
interfere, so he thinks; so do not I, and am more disposed
to believe that Louis Philippe is too prudent to run his head
into such a hornet&rsquo;s nest, and that he will content himself
with keeping matters quiet in France, without meddling with
the Spanish disputes. He had not yet received any letters
from Palmerston.<a name="FNA_22_13" id="FNA_22_13"></a><a href="#FN_22_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<span class="pagehead">HORNE AND BROUGHAM.</span>
Horne, the late Attorney-General, seems
likely to fall between the stools. When Brougham proposed
to him to take a puisne judgeship, he said he had been an
equity lawyer all his life, and had no mind to enter on a
course of common law, for which he was not qualified, and
proposed that he should not go the circuits, and be Deputy-Speaker
of the House of Lords. Brougham told him there
would be no difficulty, and then told Lord Grey he had settled
it with Horne, but did not tell him what Horne required.
The general movement was made, and when Horne desired
to see Lord Grey he told him that his terms could not be
complied with, so he became a victim to the trickery and
shuffling of the Chancellor, who wanted to get him out, and
did not care how. I hear that his colleagues are quite aware
of all his tricks and his intrigues, and have not the slightest
confidence in him. He thinks of nothing but the establishment
of political power on the basis of patronage, and accordingly
he grasps at all he can. All the commissions of
enquiry which are set on foot afford him the means of
patronage, but I doubt all will not do. He is emasculated
by being in the House of Lords, and he will hardly get anybody
to do his business for him in the House of Commons.</p>

<h3>March 12th, 1834</h3>

<p>I have been laid up with the gout for
the greater part of a fortnight, but went to Newmarket for
two days to get well, and succeeded. Weather like summer,
nothing particularly new, a long debate on the Corn Laws,
which being called an open question, the Ministers voted
different ways&mdash;that is, all the Cabinet voted one way, but
the underlings took their own course. Half the Ruralists
are furious with Government for their indecision and way
of acting on this question, but I am so totally ignorant upon
it that I cannot enter into their indignation, or exactly
understand from what it proceeds. It was pretty to see
Graham and Poulett Thomson, like two game-cocks got
loose from one pen, pecking at and spurring one another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RUSSIA AND TURKEY.</span>
Everybody agrees that the debate was very dull, and that is
all they do agree upon.</p>

<p>George Villiers writes to his family from Spain, that
nothing can be worse and more unpromising than the state of
that country. Notwithstanding his Liberal opinions and
desire to see a system of constitutional freedom established
in the Peninsula, he is obliged to confess that Spain is not
fit for such a boon, and that the materials do not exist out of
which such a social edifice can be constructed. He regards
with dismay and sorrow the tendency towards irremediable
confusion and political convulsions, and sees no daylight
through the dark prospect. He appears to regret Zea, to
whose removal he contributed, and finds more difficulties in
dealing with the present Ministers than he had with him.</p>

<h3>March 14th, 1834</h3>

<p>There is a fresh <i>démêlé</i> with Russia on
account of a new treaty concluded by Achmet Pacha at St.
Petersburg. By this Russia agrees to remit six millions of
the ten which Turkey owes her, and to give up the Principalities,
but she keeps the fortress of Silistria and the military
road, which gives her complete command over them. The
Sultan, &lsquo;not to be outdone in generosity,&rsquo; in return for so
much, kindly cedes to Russia a slip of sea-coast on the Black
Sea, adjoining another portion already ceded by the Treaty
of Adrianople as far south as Poti. This territorial acquisition
is not considerable in itself, but it embraces the
line of communication with Persia, by which we have a vast
traffic, and which Russia will be able at any time to interrupt.
This new transaction, so quietly and plausibly effected,
has thrown our Government into a great rage, and especially
his Majesty King William, who insisted upon a dozen ships
being sent off forthwith to the Mediterranean. Nothing
vigorous, however, has been done, and Palmerston has
contented himself with writing to Lord Ponsonby, desiring
him to exhort the Sultan not to ratify this treaty, and rather
to pay (or more properly, continue to owe) the whole ten
millions than accede to the wily proposal. This advice will
probably seem more friendly than disinterested, and I have
not the slightest idea of the Sultan&rsquo;s listening to it. He has,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in fact, become the vassal of Russia, and his lot is settled in
this respect, for from Russia he has most to fear and most
to hope. The conduct of our Government in this question,
has been marked by nothing but negligence and indecision,
vainly blustering and threatening at one moment and
tamely submitting and acquiescing at another, &lsquo;willing to
wound and yet afraid to strike,&rsquo; treating Russia as if she
was the formidable foe of Turkey, and allowing her so to act
as to make Turkey think her an ally and protectress, and
finally to throw herself into Russia&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>I went yesterday morning to Peel&rsquo;s house, to see his
pictures; since we met at Buckenham we have got rather
intimate. The fact is that, though I have never been a great
admirer of his character, and probably he is not improved in
high-mindedness, I am so sensible of his capacity, and of the
need in which we stand of him, that I wish to see him again
in power, and he is a very agreeable man into the bargain.
His collection is excellent, and does honour to his taste.
We talked of various matters, but the thing that struck me
most was what he said had passed between him and Stanley
the night before indicative of such good feeling between
them. It was about the job of Lord Plunket&rsquo;s with regard
to the Deanery of Down (concerning which they say there is
a very good case; not that it will do, be it ever so good, for
Plunket has a bad name, and public opinion will not pause
or retract in any concern of his). He and Stanley met at
Madame de Lieven&rsquo;s ball, and Peel said to him, &lsquo;Why did
you let that appointment take place?&rsquo; Stanley replied,
&lsquo;The fact is, I could not give the true and only excuse for
Plunket, viz., that he had signed the report, but had never
read it.&rsquo; Peel said, &lsquo;You had better give him some other
deanery and cancel this appointment.&rsquo; They talked for a
long time, but this tone and this advice exhibit a state of
sentiment by no means incompatible with a future union,
when matters are ripe for it. I found Peel full of curiosity
to know for what purpose Brougham and Denman had been
hunting each other about the County of Beds. The Chief
Justice was on the circuit at Bedford, and the Chancellor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM&rsquo;S JUDICIAL CHANGES.</span>
sent to him by special messenger to appoint a meeting.
The Chancellor went to Ampthill, and then to Bedford.
The Chief Justice had left Bedford in the morning, and
went towards London. Brougham had left his carriage at
Ampthill and hired a job one, that he might enter Bedford
incognito. Somewhere between Barnet and St. Albans they
met, and returned to town together in the Chancellor&rsquo;s job
coach. They went to Lord Grey&rsquo;s, and the next day Denman
returned to the circuit, which he had left without notice
to his brother judge or to anybody&mdash;a mystery.</p>

<h3>March 16th, 1834</h3>

<p>Heard last night the explanation of the
above. Brougham found that Williams would not do in the
Exchequer, so he shuffled up the judges and redealt them.
Williams was shoved up to the Common Pleas, Bosanquet
sent to the King&rsquo;s Bench, and James Parke put into the
Exchequer. I thought this was odd, because the Exchequer
is an inferior court; but I was told that Parke likes to be
with Lord Lyndhurst, who has now made the Court of
Exchequer of primary importance. 48,000 writs were issued
from the Exchequer last year, and only 39,000 from the
King&rsquo;s Bench. I forget what the proportions used to be,
but enormously the other way. It is quite ludicrous to talk
to any lawyer about the Chancellor; the ridicule and aversion
he has excited are universal. They think he has degraded
the profession, and his tricks are so palpable, numerous,
and mean, that political partiality can neither screen
nor defend them. As to the separation of the judicial from
the ministerial duties of his office, it is in great measure
accomplished without any legislative act, for nobody ever
thinks of bringing an original cause into his Court. He has
nothing to hear but appeals, which <i>must</i> come before him,
and lunacy and other matters, over which he has sole jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>March 19th, 1834</h3>

<p>The night before last Sheil brought on a
debate on the Turkish question, when Palmerston made a
wretched speech, and Peel attacked him very smartly, as it
is his delight to do, for he dislikes Palmerston. Talleyrand
said to me last night, &lsquo;Palmerston a très-bien parlé.&rsquo; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
told him everybody thought it pitiable. He certainly took
care to flatter France and not to offend Russia. In the
Lords Brougham took occasion, in replying to some question
of Ellenborough&rsquo;s, to defend himself from the charges which
have been brought against him of negligence and incapacity
in his judicial office, and he made out a good case for
himself as far as industry and despatch are concerned.
Nobody ever denied him the merit of the former quality.
The virulent attacks of the Tory press (that is, of the
&lsquo;Morning Post,&rsquo; by Praed, for the &lsquo;Standard&rsquo; rather defends
him) have overshot their mark, and, though the general
opinion of the Bar seems to condemn him as a bad Chancellor,
he is probably not near so bad as they endeavour to
make him out. A mind so vigorous as his will master
difficulties in a short time at which an inferior capacity
would in vain hammer away for years; but his life, habits,
and turn of mind seem all incompatible with profound law-learning.
He said to Sefton, after he had spoken, &lsquo;They had
better leave me alone. I was afraid that when Londonderry
was gone nobody would attack me, and I did not think
Ellenborough would have been damned fool enough.&rsquo; They
certainly can&rsquo;t get the best of him at the <i>gab</i>.</p>

<p>George Villiers continues to give a deplorable account of
Spanish affairs&mdash;of the imbecility of the Government, and of
the conduct of the Queen, about whom the stories of gallantry
are quite true, and he says it has done irreparable injury
to her cause. An embassy had arrived from Pedro, with a
proposition that they should concert a combined operation
for crushing the Miguelites and the Carlists both, beginning
with the former. George Villiers seems to think it feasible,
but doubts if the Spanish Government has sufficient energy
and courage to undertake such an operation.</p>

<h3>March 25th, 1834</h3>

<p>Dined with Peel on Saturday; a great
dinner with the Duke of Gloucester and the Ambassadors.
The day before, in the House of Lords, Lord Grey presented
a petition from certain members of the University of Cambridge,
praying for the admission of Dissenters to take
degrees, which he introduced with a very good speech. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DINNER AT SIR ROBERT PEEL&rsquo;S.</span>
Duke of Gloucester, who, as Chancellor of the University,
ought properly to have said whatever there was to say, was
not there (in which Silly Billy did a wise thing), so the Duke
of Wellington rose to speak in his stead. It may have been
that considering himself to stand in the Duke of Gloucester&rsquo;s
shoes, he could not make too foolish a speech, and accordingly
he delivered one of those harangues which make men
shrug their shoulders with pity or astonishment. It is
always a matter of great regret to me when he exposes himself
in this manner. After dinner at Peel&rsquo;s I talked to
Lyndhurst about it, who said, &lsquo;Unlucky thing that Chancellorship
of Oxford; it will make him commit himself in
a very inconvenient manner. The Duke is so very obstinate;
if he thought that it was possible to act any longer
upon those High Church principles it would be all very well,
but you have transferred power to a class of a lower description,
and particularly to the great body of Dissenters,
and it is obvious that those principles are now out of date;
the question is, under the circumstances, What is best
to be done?&rsquo; Lord Ellenborough entirely threw the Duke
over, and made a very good speech, agreeing to the prayer
of the petitioners, with the reservation only of certain securities
which Lord Grey himself approves of. I dined with
him the day following, and he said so, adding at the same
time, &lsquo;though I dare say they will consider them as an insult,
and make great complaints at their imposition. However, I
don&rsquo;t care for that, and if they don&rsquo;t choose to accept what
is offered them on such conditions, they may go without it.&rsquo;
There are two things which strike one (at least strike me) in
the discussion&mdash;that of the two principal actors the Duke of
Wellington is incomparably a man of a more vigorous understanding,
and of greater firmness, energy, and decision than
Lord Grey, but that Lord Grey appears like an accomplished
orator, and prudent, sagacious, liberal statesman, while the
other exhibits bigoted, narrow-minded views, ignorance almost
discreditable, and nothing but a blind zeal in deference to
the obstinate prejudices of the academical body with which
he has connected himself. Who would imagine (who heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the two men and knew nothing more of them) that the
latter is in reality immensely superior to the former in mind
and understanding? Nor must it be supposed that the Duke
of Wellington, if he came into power, would act in a manner
corresponding with his declared opinions. Very far from it;
he would do just as he did with regard to the Test Act and
the Catholic question, and if he was at the head of the
Government, he would calculate what sort and amount of
concession it was necessary to make, and would make it,
without caring a farthing about the University of Oxford or
his own former speeches. The &lsquo;Times&rsquo; in its remarks on
his speech was very insolent, but excessively droll.</p>

<p>Denman&rsquo;s peerage is much abused; it is entirely the Chancellor&rsquo;s
doing. Denman has no fortune and a feeble son to
succeed him, and it was hoped that the practice of making all
the Chief Justices Peers would have been discontinued in his
person. Brougham wrote to Lyndhurst, ostensibly to inform
him of this event, but really to apologise for the misstatements
he had made in his speech about the business he
(Lyndhurst) had done in the House of Lords and in the
Court of Chancery. Lyndhurst said (to me), &lsquo;What nonsense
it is. He has done all he could do, and so did his predecessors
before him; he has sat as long as he could, and if he
has not got through as much business it is because counsel
have made longer speeches, for I am told his practice is
never to interrupt them, to take away his papers, and come
down a few days after and deliver a written judgment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On Sunday at dinner at Lord Grey&rsquo;s I sat next to Charles
Grey, who talked of the House of Commons, and said
that there could be no question of Peel&rsquo;s superiority over
everybody there, that Stanley had not done so well this
session, had displayed so much want of judgment now, as
well as formerly, that he was evidently not fit to be leader.
He owned that Peel&rsquo;s conduct was very fair as well as
prudent, and said that if his father was to resign, he himself,
and he believed many others, would be willing to support
a Government headed by Peel. It is remarkable how men&rsquo;s
minds are gradually turning to Peel. I was amused yesterday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ADMISSION OF DISSENTERS TO THE UNIVERSITY.</span>
with Poulett Thomson, who told me that Peel had been
very courteous to him, and that they had some important
points of coincidence of opinion; that Peel did not like
Graham, Palmerston, or Grant, but to the rest of the Government
he was remarkably civil. I think he reckons without
his host if he calculates upon Peel&rsquo;s politeness extending to
the offer of a place to our Vice-President in the event of his
coming in.</p>

<h3>March 29th, 1834</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the week there was
a discussion in the House of Commons which lasted for
three mornings on the Cambridge petition. Spring Rice,
O&rsquo;Connell, Stanley, and Palmerston spoke for it; Goulburn,
Inglis, and Peel against it. Old Cobbett made as mischievous
a speech as he could to blow the coals between the parties.
Peel spoke last, and as usual very well; but several people
expected he would have supported it, and have abstained
(from prudential motives) from saying anything likely to
offend the Dissenters. I expected no such thing; he was
not violent, and addressed his argument to the weak parts of
his adversaries&rsquo; speeches rather than against the general
principles of toleration; and I still think that when the
great question of concessions to the Dissenters comes to be
argued he will not be found in the ranks of their virulent
and uncompromising opponents. It would have been an
extraordinary thing indeed if he had all of a sudden stood
forth in the character of an anti-Churchman, for such he
especially would have been considered if he had united himself
with the petitioners, and he would have disgusted and
alienated all the High Churchmen and High Tories to a degree
which must have made a fresh and irreconcilable breach between
them. This would not have been judicious in his
position, and I am satisfied that he took the most prudent
course. I am the more satisfied of it from the circumstance
that his speech by no means gave unalloyed pleasure to the
&lsquo;Standard,&rsquo; which is the organ of the High Church party. I
feel it a strange thing to find myself the advocate and
admirer of Peel; but there is such a dearth of talent, his
superiority is so obvious, and it is so very desirable that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
something like strength should be infused into the Government,
that I am compelled to overlook his faults without
being the least blind to them. I ascribe to him no more
elevation of character than I did before; but we must take
what we can get and make use of the existing materials, and
for this reason I watch with anxiety his conduct, because I
am persuaded that he is under present circumstances our
best and only refuge.</p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor<a name="FNA_23_01" id="FNA_23_01"></a><a href="#FN_23_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
called on me the other day, and
talking over the business that had been done by Brougham,
and the recent discussion about it, he said that he had taken
the trouble to examine the returns of hearings, decrees, and
orders, and he found that there was scarcely a shade of difference
between what had been done severally by Eldon, Lyndhurst,
and Brougham in equal spaces of time. (Eldon and
Lyndhurst had the Bankruptcy business besides.) This is a
clear case for the Chancellor, and it is only fair that it should
be known. His friends think him much altered in spirits and
appearance; he has never shaken off his unhappiness at his
brother&rsquo;s death, to whom he seems to have been tenderly
attached. It is only justice to acknowledge his virtues in
private life, which are unquestionably conspicuous. I am
conscious of having often spoken of him with asperity, and
it is some satisfaction to my conscience to do him this justice.
When the greatest (I will not say the best) men are often
influenced by pique or passion, by a hundred petty feelings
which their philosophy cannot silence or their temperament
obeys, it is no wonder that we poor wretches who are cast in
less perfect moulds should be still more liable to these pernicious
influences; and it is only by keeping an habitual
watch over our own minds and thoughts, and steadily resolving
never to be turned from considerations of justice and
truth, that we can hope to walk through life with integrity
and impartiality. I believe what I have said of Brougham
to be correct in the main&mdash;that he is false, tricking, ambitious,
and unprincipled, and as such I will show him up when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PERSONAL REFLECTIONS.</span>
I can&mdash;but though I do not like him and he has offended
me&mdash;that is, has wounded my vanity (the greatest of all
offences)&mdash;I only feel it the more necessary on that account
to be on my guard against my own impressions and prejudices,
and to take every opportunity of exhibiting the
favourable side of the picture, and render justice to the
talents and virtues which cannot be denied him.</p>

[Sir Lancelot Shadwell, Vice-Chancellor of England.]</p></div>

<h3>April 3rd, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday I was forty years old, an anniversary
much too melancholy to think <ins class="correction" title = "text reads&ldquo;off&rdquo;">of</ins>;
and when I reflect
how intolerably these forty years have been wasted, how
unprofitably spent, how little store laid up for the future,
how few the pleasurable recollections of the past, a feeling of
pain and humiliation comes across me that makes my cheeks
tingle and burn as I write. It is very seldom that I indulge
in moralising in this Journal of mine; if anybody ever reads
it, what will they care for my feelings and regrets? It is no
reason, they will think, that because I have wasted my time
they should waste theirs in reading the record of follies
which are nothing more than the great mass of the world
are every day committing; idleness, vanity, and selfishness
are our besetting sins, and we are perpetually whirled about
by one or other of them. It is certainly more amusing, both
to other people and to myself (when I look back at what I
have written), to read the anecdotes and events of the day
than all this moral stuff (by which I mean stuff as applied
to me, not as being despicable in itself), but every now and
then the fancy takes me, and I think I find relief by giving
vent on paper to that which I cannot say to anybody.
&lsquo;Cela fait partie de cette doctrine intérieure qu&rsquo;il ne faut
jamais communiquer&rsquo; (Stendhal). <i>Jam satis est</i>, and I will
go to other things&mdash;the foreign or domestic scraps I have
picked up.</p>

<p>Parliament being <i>en relâche</i>, there are few people in town.
William Ponsonby, whom I met the other evening, told me
he had just returned from the assizes at Dorchester, where
some men had been convicted of illegal association. On the
event of this trial, he said, the lower and labouring classes had
their eyes fixed, and the conviction was therefore of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
consequence; any relaxation of the sentence would have been
impossible under the circumstances, and though a great disposition
was evinced, partly by the press, by petitions, and
by some speeches in Parliament, to get them left off more
easily, Melbourne very wisely did not wait for more manifestations,
but packed them off, and they are gone. William
Ponsonby told me that the demoralisation in that part of the
country is very great&mdash;the distress not severe, no political
disaffection, but a recklessness, a moral obtuseness, exceedingly
disgusting. There was a certain trial, or rather case
(for the grand jury could not find a bill), in which a woman
had murdered a child, got by her son out of a girl who lodged
in her cottage. The only evidence by which she could have
been convicted would have been that of the son himself, and
he refused to speak. The crime went unpunished; but I
mention this to introduce what grew out of it. One of the
lawyers said that in the course of the investigations which
this case had occasioned it had been discovered (though not
in a way which admitted of any proofs being adduced and
any measures adopted upon it) that there was a woman whose
trade was to get rid of bastard children, either by procuring
abortions or destroying them when born, and that she had a
regular price for either
operation.<a name="FNA_23_02" id="FNA_23_02"></a><a href="#FN_23_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
I don&rsquo;t suppose that the
average state of morals is much worse in one county than in
another; but it is very remarkable that while education has
been more widely diffused than heretofore, and there is a
strong Puritanical spirit at work and vast talk about religious
observances, there should be such a brutish manifestation of
the moral condition of the lower classes, and that they should
be apparently so little humanised and reclaimed by either
education or religion. In this country all is contrast&mdash;contrast
between wealth the most enormous and poverty the
most wretched, between an excess of sanctity and an atrocity
of crime.</p>

[The same thing was proved more than thirty years later, on the trial
of Charlotte Winsor, who eventually escaped the fate she deserved on the
ground of some legal technicality which was taken up to the House of Lords,
and though it was decided against the prisoner, the Government refused,
after a considerable lapse of time, to have her executed.]</p></div>

<span class="pagehead">OXFORD ADDRESS TO THE KING.</span>
George Villiers and Howard write equally bad accounts
from their respective Courts, neither seeing any hope of the
termination of the Peninsular contests, and each of them alike
disgusted with the men they have to deal with. Howard
says that we could put an end to the Portuguese affair whenever
we chose, and that they would submit to British power
without thinking it a degradation; that Miguel is not popular
in Portugal, but that the priests have made a crusade against
Pedro and Liberal principles, and that they drive the peasantry
into the Miguelite ranks by the terrors of excommunication;
that the only reason why Pedro&rsquo;s military operations are
successful is that he has got an English corps, against which
the Portuguese will not fight.</p>

<h3>April 21st, 1834</h3>

<p>At Buckenham and Newmarket for the last
fortnight, and all things forgotten but racing. Seymour
Bathurst&rsquo;s sudden death called me up to town on Tuesday
night, to go to Court on Wednesday. Then I saw the Duke
of Wellington march up at the head of the Doctors to
present the Oxford petition, attired in his academical robes;
and as I looked at him thus bedight, and then turned my
eyes to his portraits in the pictures of his battles which
adorn the walls, I thought how many and various were the
parts he had played. He made a great boggling of reading
his petition, for it was on a long and broad parchment, and
he required both hands to hold it and one to hold his glasses.
This is the day for the procession of the Trade Unions, and
all London is alive with troops, artillery and police. I don&rsquo;t
suppose anything will happen, and so much has the general
alarm of these Unions subsided that there is very little apprehension,
though some curiosity to see how it goes off.</p>

<h3>April 23rd, 1834</h3>

<p>Nothing could go off more quietly than the
procession on Monday. There were about 25,000 men,
mostly well dressed, no noise or tumult, a vast crowd. It
was a failure altogether; Melbourne&rsquo;s answer was good.
They say 250,000 men are enrolled in the Unions, and the
slang name for those who won&rsquo;t belong to them is &lsquo;dungs;&rsquo;
the intimidation used is great. There was quite as great
a crowd assembled yesterday to see old Lady Hertford&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
funeral go by. The King sent all the royal carriages, and
every other carriage in London was there, I believe&mdash;a
pompous piece of folly, and the King&rsquo;s compliment rather
a queer one, as the only ground on which she could claim
such an honour was that of having been George IV.&rsquo;s mistress.
Brougham made one of his exhibitions in the House of Lords
the other night about the Cambridge petition, quizzing the
Duke of Gloucester with mock gravity. It was very droll
and very witty, I fancy, but very unbecoming his station.
Last night O&rsquo;Connell spoke for five hours on the repeal of the
Union.</p>

<h3>April 25th, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday the Privy Council met to hear the
London University petition, praying for a charter, and the
counter-petitions of Oxford and Cambridge and the medical
bodies. The assemblage was rather curious, considering the
relative political position of some of the parties. All the
Cabinet Ministers were summoned; Lords Grey and Holland
were there, the Chancellor, Denman, Lyndhurst, Eldon, the
two Archbishops, and the Bishop of London. Old Eldon got a
fall as he came into the house and hurt his head. Brougham
and the rest were full of civilities and tenderness, but he
said &lsquo;it was of no consequence, for the <i>brains</i> had been
knocked out long ago.&rsquo; Wetherell made an amusing speech,
and did not conclude. It is seldom that the sounds of
merriment are heard within those walls, but he made the
Lords laugh and the gallery too. There were Allen of
Holland House and Phillpotts sitting cheek by jowl to hear
the discussion.</p>

<h3>May 11th, 1834</h3>

<p>More than three weeks, and <i>rebus Newmarketianis
versatus</i>, I have written nothing. The debate on
the repeal of the Union was more remarkable for the length
than the excellence of the speeches, except Spring Rice&rsquo;s,
which was both long and good, and Peel&rsquo;s, the latter supereminently
so. O&rsquo;Connell spoke for five hours and a quarter,
and Rice for six hours; each occupied a night, after the
manner of American orators. The minority was much
smaller than was expected. Since that the only question of
consequence in the House of Commons has been the Pension
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LONDON UNIVERSITY CHARTER.</span>
List, on which Government got a larger majority than they
had hoped for, and such an one as to set the matter at rest for
some time. Peel again spoke very well, and old Byng made
a very independent, gentlemanlike speech. Independence
now-a-days relates more to constituents than to the governing
power. Nobody is suspected of being dependent on the
Crown or the Minister, and the question is if a man be independent
of the popular cry or of his own constituency.</p>

<p>The King has been exhibiting some symptoms of a disordered
mind, not, however, amounting to anything like
actual derangement, only morbid irritability and activity&mdash;reviewing
the Guards and <i>blowing up</i> people at Court. He
made the Guards, both horse and foot, perform their evolutions
before him; he examined their barracks, clothes, arms,
and accoutrements, and had a musket brought to him, that
he might show them the way to use it in some new sort of
exercise he wanted to introduce; in short, he gave a great
deal of trouble and made a fool of himself. He was very
angry with Lord de Saumarez for not attending Keat&rsquo;s
funeral, and still more angry because he would begin explaining
and apologizing, first at the levee and then at the
drawing-room; and he reprehended him very sharply at
both places. An explanation afterwards took place through
Lord Camden, to whom he said that he was angry because
de Saumarez would prate at the levee, when he told him
that it was not a proper place for discussing the subject.</p>

<p>The debate at the Council Board terminated after two
more days&rsquo; speaking. It was tiresome on the whole.
Brougham is a bad presiding judge, for he will talk so much
to the counsel, and being very anxious to abbreviate the
business, he ought to have avoided saying pungent things,
which elicited rejoinders and excited heat. The extreme
gravity and patient attention of old Eldon struck me forcibly
as contrasted with the air of <i>ennui</i>, the frequent and audible
yawns, and the flippant and sarcastic interruptions of the
Chancellor. Wetherell made a very able speech, which he
afterwards published. The most striking incident occurred
in an answer of Bickersteth&rsquo;s to one of the Chancellor&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
interruptions. He said, talking of degrees, &lsquo;Pray, Mr.
Bickersteth, what is to prevent the London University
granting degrees <i>now</i>?&rsquo; to which, he replied, &lsquo;The universal
scorn and contempt of mankind.&rsquo; Brougham said no more;
the effect was really fine. There was a little debate upon
Portugal in the House of Commons on Friday, in which
Palmerston got roughly handled by Baring. A report was
believed that Don Carlos had sailed for England, and that
an agreement had been concluded between Miguel and
Pedro, but it turned out to be false. Nobody, however,
doubts that the quadruple alliance will settle the Portuguese
business, if not the Spanish.</p>

<h3>May 12th, 1834</h3>

<p>There was a report yesterday that Palmerston
was out and Durham in his place. The latter was
under the gallery when Palmerston made that woful exhibition
the other night, and must have been well satisfied.
I met Peel at dinner yesterday, and after it he talked to me of
this report, which he concluded was not true; but he said that
Palmerston had seemed bereft of his senses, and that in his
speech he had attempted a new line quite unusual with him&mdash;that
of humour&mdash;and anything so miserable he had never
heard. He then talked of Stanley; expressed his indignation
at hearing O&rsquo;Connell bepraised by the men he is always
vilifying, especially by Stanley himself, of whom he had
spoken in the early part of the same night in such terms as
these: &lsquo;The honourable gentleman, with his usual disregard
of veracity, ...&rsquo; and again &lsquo;he attacked him, but took
care how he attacked others, who he knew were not restrained
by obligations such as he was under to bear with
his language;&rsquo; in other words, calling him a liar and a
coward; and after this Stanley condescended to flatter him
and applaud his speech. He said that he had expected
better things of Stanley, and was really distressed to hear it.</p>

<p>I dined with the Duke of Wellington on Saturday.
Arbuthnot was there, and he said the Duke is in a state of
unutterable disgust with the present Government and their
proceedings, particularly with their foreign policy, which he
fancies they shape in systematic and wilful opposition to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND THE WHIGS.</span>
own. This, of course, is merely his imagination, and rather
a preposterous notion. He says the Duke does not think
well of the state of the country, but that he grasps with
eagerness at any symptoms of returning or increasing prosperity,
and (what is rather inconsistent with his bad opinion
of affairs) he is always telling the foreigners (i.e. the Ambassadors)
who talk to him that they will fall into a great
error if they think the power or resources of England in any
way impaired. His antipathy to the Whigs, is, however,
invincible, and of very ancient date, as this proves. Arbuthnot
said that he was looking over a box of papers the
other day, and hit upon the copy of a letter he had written
to Lord Liverpool, by desire of some of his principal colleagues,
to dissuade him from quitting office, which, he
thought of doing at the time of the first Lady Liverpool&rsquo;s
death. With it there was a scrap on which was written,
&lsquo;Taken down from the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s own lips;&rsquo; and
this was an argument that, in the event of his refusing, he
(the Duke) should think himself at liberty to join any other
party or set of men, but that his great object was to keep
the Whigs out of power, as he was convinced that whenever
they got in they would ruin the country. Lord Liverpool
said that they (The Tories) had been too long in possession
of the Government.</p>

<h3>May 23rd, 1834</h3>

<p>Newmarket, Epsom, and so forth. Nothing
remarkably new. In the House of Commons the Poor Law
Bill has been going on smoothly; in the House of Lords
little of note but one of Brougham&rsquo;s exhibitions. Old
Wynford brought in a very absurd Bill for the better observance
of the Sabbath (an old sinner he, who never cared
three straws for the Sabbath), which Brougham attacked
with excessive virulence and all his powers of ridicule and
sarcasm. His speech made everybody laugh, very heartily,
but on a division, the Bishops all voting with Wynford, the
latter carried the second reading by three in a very thin
House. The next day the Chancellor came down with a
protest, written in his most pungent style, very smart, but
more like a bit of an article in the &lsquo;Edinburgh Review&rsquo; than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a Parliamentary protest. Wynford was in the House when
he entered his protest, and he called out to him, &lsquo;Holloa,
<i>Best</i>, look at my protest!&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is a very strong impression abroad that the King is
cracked, and I dare say there is some truth in it. He gets
so very choleric, and is so indecent in his wrath. Besides
his squabble with old Lord de Saumarez, he broke out the
other day at the Exhibition (Somerset House). They were
showing him the pictures, and Sir Martin Shee (I believe,
but am not sure), pointing out Admiral Napier&rsquo;s, said, &lsquo;That
is one of our naval heroes; to which his Majesty was
pleased to reply that if he served him right he should kick
him downstairs for so terming him. But the maddest
thing of all is what appeared in the &lsquo;Gazette&rsquo; of Tuesday&mdash;the
peerage conferred on &mdash;&mdash;. She is a disreputable, half-mad
woman! he, perhaps, thought it fair to give her this
compensation for not being Queen, for he wanted to marry
her, and would have done so if the late king would have
consented.</p>

<p>On Monday last I went to Petworth, and saw the finest
<i>fête</i> that could be given. Lord Egremont has been accustomed
some time in the winter to feast the poor of the
adjoining parishes (women and children, not men) in the
riding-house and tennis court, where they were admitted
by relays. His illness prevented the dinner taking place;
but when he recovered he was bent upon having it, and, as
it was put off till the summer, he had it arranged in the
open air, and a fine sight it was; fifty-four tables, each fifty
feet long, were placed in a vast semicircle on the lawn before
the house. Nothing could be more amusing than to look at
the preparations. The tables were all spread with cloths,
and plates, and dishes; two great tents were erected in the
middle to receive the provisions, which were conveyed in
carts, like ammunition. Plum puddings and loaves were
piled like cannon balls, and innumerable joints of boiled and
roast beef were spread out, while hot joints were prepared in
the kitchen, and sent forth as soon as the firing of guns
announced the hour of the feast. Tickets were given to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FÊTE AT PETWORTH.</span>
inhabitants of a certain district, and the number was about
4,000; but, as many more came, the old Peer could not
endure that there should be anybody hungering outside his
gates, and he went out himself and ordered the barriers to be
taken down and admittance given to all. They think 6,000
were fed. Gentlemen from the neighbourhood carved for
them, and waiters were provided from among the peasantry.
The food was distributed from the tents and carried off upon
hurdles to all parts of the semicircle. A band of music
paraded round, playing gay airs. The day was glorious&mdash;an
unclouded sky and soft southern breeze. Nothing could
exceed the pleasure of that fine old fellow; he was in and
out of the windows of his room twenty times, enjoying the
sight of these poor wretches, all attired in their best, cramming
themselves and their brats with as much as they could
devour, and snatching a day of relaxation and happiness.
After a certain time the women departed, but the park
gates were thrown open: all who chose came in, and walked
about the shrubbery and up to the windows of the house.
At night there was a great display of fireworks, and I should
think, at the time they began, not less than 10,000 people
were assembled. It was altogether one of the gayest and
most beautiful spectacles I ever saw, and there was something
affecting in the contemplation of that old man&mdash;on the verge
of the grave, from which he had only lately been reprieved,
with his mind as strong and his heart as warm as ever&mdash;rejoicing
in the diffusion of happiness and finding keen
gratification in relieving the distresses and contributing to
the pleasures of the poor. I thought how applicable to him,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, was that panegyric of Burke&rsquo;s on the
Indian kings: &lsquo;delighting to reign in the dispensation of
happiness during the contracted space of human life, strained
with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind to
extend the dominion of his bounty ... and to perpetuate
himself from generation to generation as the guardian, the
protector, the nourisher of mankind.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>May 24th, 1834</h3>

<p>The Chancellor, who loves to unbosom himself
to Sefton because he knows the latter thinks him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
finest fellow breathing, tells him that it is nuts to him to be
attacked by noble Lords in the Upper House, and that they
had better leave him alone if they care for their own hides.
Since he loves these assaults, last night he got his bellyful,
for he was baited by a dozen at least, and he did not come
out of the <i>mêlée</i> so chuckling and happy as usual. The
matter related to the Pluralities Bill, which he had introduced
some nights before, in an empty House, without giving
notice, and after having told many people (the Archbishop
of York among others) that there was nothing more to be
done that night. In short, he was at his tricks again, lying
and shuffling, false and then insolent, and all for no discernible
end. The debate exhibits a detail of his misstatements,
and of all his wriggling and plunging to get out of the
scrape he had got himself into. It is because scarcely any or
rather no motive was apparent that it is with difficulty believed
that he meant to deceive anybody. But it is in the nature
of the man; he cannot go straightforward; some object, no
matter how trivial, presents itself to his busy and distempered
mind, and he immediately begins to think by what
artifice and what underhand work he can bring it about;
and thus he exposes himself to the charges of dishonourable
conduct without any adequate consideration or cause. He
reminds me of the man in &lsquo;Jonathan Wild&rsquo; who was a
rogue by force of habit, who could not keep his hand out of
his neighbour&rsquo;s pocket though he knew there was nothing
in it, nor help cheating at cards though he was aware he
should not be paid if he won. It is thought that the exhibition
of last night will not be without its influence upon
the fate of this Administration.</p>

<h3>May 27th, 1834</h3>

<p>The Government is on the very brink of dissolution.
The Irish Church Bill is the immediate cause,
Stanley and Graham standing out against the majority of the
Cabinet with regard to the Appropriation clause. Stanley,
<i>they think</i>, would have knocked under if Graham had not
been very fierce and urged him on to resistance. They attribute
all the present bother to Graham, who pleads conscience
and religious feelings. It is impossible to guess how it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SPLIT ON THE IRISH CHURCH.</span>
end, and there is a terrible turmoil. Stanley was with the
King for two hours yesterday. The violent party evidently wish
Lord Grey to let Stanley go out, and those who choose to go
with him, and to reinforce the Cabinet with Durham, Mulgrave,
and that sort of thing, and what they call &lsquo;throw
themselves on the House of Commons and the country.&rsquo;
On the other hand the half-Tories and moderates wish the
Government to adopt a moderate tone and course, and seek
support from the House of Lords. As to the House of Commons,
it is a curious body, supporting the Ministers through
thick and thin one day and buffeting them the next. On the
Bank question the night before last Althorp was beaten,
after imploring everybody to come and support him and
making the strangest declarations. I am very sorry that
there should be a chance of a split on such a question as the
Irish Church, which really is not tenable. His colleagues
(or their friends at least) suspect that Graham kicks up this
dust with ulterior views, and they think he aims at a junction
with Peel&mdash;Stanley of course included&mdash;and coming
into office with a moderate mixed party. It will be a great
evil if the Government is broken up just now, but it is quite
clear that they cannot go on long; it is a question of months.
The Duke of Wellington told me yesterday that he could do
nothing, and he will be rather shy of giving to the world a
second volume of that old business in which he got so bedevilled
two years ago.</p>

<p>The Lievens are recalled, which is a great misfortune to
society. She is inconsolable. The pill is gilded well, for he
is made governor to the Imperial Prince, the Emperor&rsquo;s
eldest son; but the old story of Stratford Canning, and
Palmerston&rsquo;s obstinate refusal to appoint anybody else, has
probably contributed to this change. His colleagues have
endeavoured to persuade him to cancel the appointment and
name Mulgrave, whom they wish to provide for, but he will
not hear of it. I can&rsquo;t conceive why they don&rsquo;t let him go
out upon it; they would be the gainers in every way. We
are now in what is called a mess; the Whigs have put
matters in such a condition that they cannot govern the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
country themselves and that nobody else can govern it
either. &lsquo;Time and the hour run through the roughest
day.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>May 28th, 1834</h3>

<p>On returning from Epsom I heard that
Stanley, Graham, and Richmond had resigned, and it was
supposed Ripon would follow their
example.<a name="FNA_23_03" id="FNA_23_03"></a><a href="#FN_23_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Althorp adjourned
the debate till Monday next. Sefton &lsquo;never was so
happy in his life.&rsquo; It is a bad sign when he is happy&mdash;not
meaning to be wicked, only very foolish and violent. I have
rarely seen the effects of a neglected education and a vivacious
temperament manifested in a more remarkable way
than in Sefton, who has naturally a great deal of cleverness,
but who, from the above causes and the absence of the
habit of moral discipline and of calm and patient reflection,
is a fool, and a very mischievous one. They will be forced
to put Peers in the vacant places, because nobody can get
re-elected. The rotten boroughs now seem not quite such
abominations, or at all events they had some compensating
advantages.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_23_03" id="FN_23_03"></a><a href="#FNA_23_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[The members of the Grey Administration who seceded on the
Appropriation Resolution (as it was termed), moved by Mr. Ward, were
the Duke of Richmond, Postmaster-General; the Earl of Ripon, Privy Seal;
Mr. Stanley, Cabinet Secretary; and Sir James Graham, First Lord of the
Admiralty. The Marquis of Conyngham became Postmaster-General, the
Earl of Carlisle Privy Seal, Lord Auckland first Lord of the Admiralty,
and Mr. Spring Rice Colonial Secretary.]</p></div>

<h3>June 1st, 1834</h3>

<p>The arrangements rendered necessary by the
recent resignations were pretty quickly made, but they have
given universal dissatisfaction. Whigs, Tories, and Radicals
join in full cry against them, and the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; in a succession
of bitter, vituperative articles, very well done, fires off
its contempt and disgust at the paltry patching up of the
Cabinet. The most unpopular appears to be Lord Auckland&rsquo;s
appointment, and, though I like him personally, it certainly
does appear strange and objectionable. He has neither
reputation nor political calibre to entitle him to such an
elevation, and his want of urbanity and forbidding manner
seem to render him peculiarly unfit for the post they have
conferred on him. [Auckland turned out a very popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE IRISH CHURCH.</span>
and, I believe, very good First Lord of the Admiralty. I
have heard many praises and not one complaint of him.&mdash;<i>December
7th, 1834</i>.] The general opinion is that this
Cabinet, so amended, cannot go on long; but as they clearly
mean to throw themselves upon the House of Commons, and
as the House will at all events support them for the present,
they will probably last some time longer; they will at any
rate, scramble through this session, and during the recess it
will be seen whether they can acquire public confidence and
what chance they have of carrying on the government.</p>

<p>After much conversation with Duncannon, Sefton, Mulgrave,
and others, I have acquired a tolerably correct understanding
of the history of these inconvenient proceedings.
The speech of Lord John Russell, to which all this hubbub
is attributed, may have somewhat accelerated, but did not
produce, the crisis. The difference has long existed in the
Cabinet on the subject of the Irish Church, and was well
known, for Althorp stated as much last year. Stanley and
Graham were both vehemently opposed to any Parliamentary
appropriation of the surplus revenues of the Irish Church,
but not exactly on the same grounds. Stanley denies the
right of Parliament to interfere at all; that is, he asserts
that Parliament has no more right to deal with the revenues
of the Church than it would have to deal with his estate.
Graham does not deny the right, but contends that it is not
expedient, that the connexion between the two countries is
mainly held together by the Protestant Church, and that
any meddling with the Establishment will inevitably lead to
its downfall. He stands upon religious grounds. I confess
myself to be lost in astonishment at the views they take on
this subject; that after swallowing the camel of the Reform
Bill, they should strain at the gnats which were perched
upon the camel&rsquo;s back, that they should not have perceived
from the first that such reforms as these must inevitably be
consequent upon the great measure, and, above all, that the
prevalence of public opinion, abstract justice, and the condition
of Ireland all loudly call for their adoption. However,
such are their opinions, and doubtless very conscientiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
entertained. Upon Ward&rsquo;s motion being announced,
it was proposed in the Cabinet that the difficulty should be
waived for the present by moving the previous question,
and to this the dissentients agreed; but on further investigation
they discerned that if this was moved, in all probability
it would not be carried, and under these circumstances
Stanley proposed at once to resign. In the Cabinet some
were for accepting and others for refusing his resignation,
and matters remained unsettled when Althorp went down to
the House of Commons on the night of Ward&rsquo;s motion. It
was strictly true (as he said) that he was informed while
Ward was speaking that they had resigned. The King accepted
their resignations at once, and appears to have
expressed his opinion that they adopted the proper course,
but he told the Duke of Richmond that the four members of
the Cabinet who had quitted it were the four whom he liked
best of them all. When they were gone it was to be settled
how their places were to be supplied. Ellice and Spring
Rice were indispensable; the Radicals wanted Durham; the
Whigs wanted Radnor, Abercromby, and Hobhouse; Lord
Lansdowne was wavering, for he is likewise opposed to any
meddling with the Church, though not perhaps to the extent
that the seceders are, or to such a degree as to make his
resignation imperative. However, he haggled, and they
appear to have thought him of consequence enough to bribe
him high to remain. He made Durham&rsquo;s exclusion a <i>sine
quâ non</i>, but I believe all the others were equally opposed to
his re-admission. Spring Rice and Auckland are Lansdowne&rsquo;s
personal friends and firmest adherents, and their
promotion is very agreeable to him (if he did not insist upon
it). Mulgrave so entirely expected to come in that he told
me on Epsom racecourse on Thursday last that he was to be
one of the new Ministers, though he did not know which
place he was to have. Great, therefore, was his disgust
when they only offered him the Post Office without the
Cabinet. He refused it with some indignation, and thinks
himself very ill used. I do not yet know what are the
reasons which induced them to make the arrangements they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">HISTORY OF THE CRISIS.</span>
have done, and deterred them from applying to any of the
above-mentioned men. It certainly has given great disgust,
and will not serve to make the Administration more popular
than before. Durham is of course furious, and if Abercromby
and the others did not expect or desire to come in,
they will nevertheless resent being passed over, and in favour
of such people.</p>

<h3>June 2nd, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday I dined with Stanley; there was
a vast deal of fine company, outs and ins, Richmond, who
would not <i>stay</i> in the Post Office, and Mulgrave who would
not <i>come</i> into it, Auckland, Palmerston, &amp;c. After dinner
Stanley talked to Mulgrave and me about the whole business;
he said that above three weeks ago, in consequence of the difference
in the Cabinet, which everybody knew, he had pressed
his resignation on his colleagues, who refused to take it, that
he had agreed to vote for the previous question on Ward&rsquo;s
motion, but they were informed it would not be carried. He
then said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take my resignation?&rsquo; Still they
demurred, and on that day nothing was settled. He then
saw the King, who agreed to accept his resignation conditionally,
provided Lord Grey could make other arrangements,
and desired Stanley to go down to his colleagues and talk it
over. He replied that it was too late, that he ought then to
be in his place in the House of Commons, as the debate was
going on. He went down, saw Lord Grey, settled with him
that he should resign, and then sent into the House of
Commons to Althorp to let him know that it was so settled.
In such hurry, uncertainty, and confusion was this business
done. Stanley talked not with acrimony, but with something
like contempt of the strange situation in which the
Government, and particularly Lord Grey, is placed, and
he &lsquo;hoped&rsquo; they might be able to go on in a tone which,
implied great doubt if they would. He said &lsquo;that Lord Grey
continues to preside over a Cabinet which is to a certain
degree committed to the principle of a measure of which
he disapproves, and he accepts the resignation of the
colleagues with whom he agrees; that if in the House of
Commons to-night no concession is made to the principle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the measure under discussion, it will appear strange and
unaccountable why the seceders have been suffered to go.
If any be made, it will be inconsistent with the letter which
Lord Grey has just written to Ebrington, in a strain as
conservative as the King&rsquo;s speech to the bishops.&rsquo; Thus
Lord Grey appears to be tossed on the horns of a very
inconvenient dilemma. This speech of the King&rsquo;s, which
Stanley alluded to, has made a great noise, and is matter of
considerable triumph to the Conservatives. It is reported
in the papers as it was really delivered, except some absurdities
with which it was mixed. It is by no means a bad
speech, and very decided in its tone; but what matters
decision and a peremptory tone from a man so easily led or
misled as the King? Lord Grey&rsquo;s letter was addressed to
Ebrington in reply to an address signed by many supporters
of Government, and has been lying on the table at Brookes&rsquo;
for public inspection.</p>

<h3>June 3rd, 1834</h3>

<p>Lord Althorp summoned a meeting yesterday
in Downing Street, which was numerously attended, though
some of the usual supporters of Government stayed away as
followers of Stanley. He invited them to support the previous
question, when there was a good deal of speaking for and
against, chiefly among county members, and a good deal of
cheering at his saying he hoped he had their confidence;
but the meeting broke up without any satisfactory conclusion,
and at five o&rsquo;clock the general impression was that
Government would be beaten, and this in spite of a conviction
that they would resign if they were. In the morning
I met Graham, who said that he did not know whether he
and Stanley would speak or not, that they could not support
the previous question without repudiating the declaration
with which it was to be accompanied, that he considered the
question to involve the fate of the Irish Church, and with it
the connexion between the two countries. I told him we
differed entirely, but that I would not enter upon any argument
on the subject; that it was very unfortunate, and I
thought the Government would not stand. He said a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MR. STANLEY IN OPPOSITION.</span>
tremendous contest must ensue upon the great question, and
so we parted.</p>

<p>In the evening a very full House. Lord Althorp stated that
the King had issued a Commission, or rather extended the
powers of one that already existed, for the purpose of effecting
the objects contemplated by the resolution, and begged Ward
to withdraw his motion. He would not, and then Althorp
moved the previous question, which, to the astonishment of
everybody, was carried by a very great majority, all the
Tories voting with Government. Stanley spoke, and spoke
very well, but with considerable acrimony and in a tone
which demonstrates the breach between him and his old
colleagues to be irreparable. He was vociferously cheered
by the Tories, especially at one passage of his speech about
a Chancellor of the Exchequer and his clerical budget which,
however pungent and smart, appears to me imprudent and
worth nothing as argument. I am very sorry he has taken
such a line upon this question. His scruples have come too
late to be serviceable to the cause he espouses, and all he
can do is to fan the flame of religious discord and throw innumerable
embarrassments in the way of settling a very
difficult question, the ultimate solution of which is no longer
doubtful.</p>

<h3>June 5th, 1834</h3>

<p>The Portuguese business is over&mdash;that is, for
the present&mdash;but Lord William Russell (whom I met at dinner
at Richmond the day before yesterday) told me he did not
think Pedro would be able to keep possession of the country,
and that another revolution would probably take place whenever
the foreign troops in his pay were disbanded; the party
against him is too strong; he said that nothing but an inconceivable
succession of blunders and great want of spirit and
enterprise on the part of Miguel could have prevented his
success, as at one time he had 70,000 men, while the other
had not above 8,000 or 10,000 cooped up in Oporto, which
is not a defensible place; that Miguel might at any moment
during the contest have put an end to it. The country is in
a dreadfully ruined state from frequent exactions and the
depression of commerce and cultivation, but Carvalho, Pedro&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Minister of Finance, told Lord William he should have no
difficulty with his budget, and could find money to discharge
all the claims upon Government. The source from which he
expects to derive his assets is the confiscated Church property,
which is very great. Money, however, is so plentiful
here, that the Portuguese Government have been offered a
loan of a million at eighty, which they have
declined<a name="FNA_23_04" id="FNA_23_04"></a><a href="#FN_23_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

[The Quadruple Treaty for the pacification of the Peninsular kingdoms
was signed in London on the 22nd of April; and on the 9th of May a
decisive battle had been gained by the troops of Don Pedro over those of
Don Miguel. Don Carlos and Don Miguel soon afterwards withdrew from
the Peninsula.]</p></div>

<h3>June 7th, 1834</h3>

<p>I was in the House of Lords last night to
hear a long debate on the Commission, when Goderich made
a very good speech, defending himself for his resignation
and attacking the instrument; like other people, as soon as
he got out of office he spoke with greater energy and force.
I thought Lord Grey was rather feeble, though energetic
enough in declaration and expression. Phillpotts I did not
hear, but he was wretchedly bad, they told me. The Chancellor,
to the surprise of everyone, made the strongest declaration
of his resolution not to permit a fraction of the revenues
of the Irish Church to be diverted to Catholic purposes&mdash;the
purposes, in my mind, to which they ought to be diverted,
and to which they in the end must and will be. The
Government is now reformed, and will scramble and totter
on for some time. Things are not ripe for a change, but
people will continue more and more to look for a junction
between Peel and Stanley. God forbid, however, that we
should have two parties established upon the principles of a
religious opposition to each other; it would be the worst of
evils, and yet the times appear to threaten something of the
sort. There is the gabble of &lsquo;the Church in danger,&rsquo; the
menacing and sullen disposition of the Dissenters, all armed
with new power, and the restless and increasing turbulence
of the Catholics, all hating one another, and the elements of
discord stirred up first by one and then another.</p>

<h3>June 9th, 1834</h3>

<p>Melbourne said to me on Saturday night, &lsquo;You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON AT OXFORD.</span>
know why Brougham made that violent declaration against the
Catholics in his speech the other night, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;No.&rsquo; Then he added, &lsquo;That was for Spring Rice&rsquo;s election,
to please the Dissenters.&rsquo; However, Duncannon says he does
not believe it was for that object, but certainly thrown out
as a sop to the Dissenters generally, who are violently opposed
to any provision being made for the Catholic Clergy. Duncannon
added that &lsquo;those were his (Brougham&rsquo;s) opinions as
far as he had any, as they were not very strong on any
subject.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>June 15th, 1834</h3>

<p>Ascot races last week; many people kept
away at Oxford, which seems to have been a complete Tory
affair, and on the whole a very disgraceful exhibition of
bigotry and party spirit; plenty of shouting and that sort of
enthusiasm, which is of no value except to the foolish people
who were the object of it, and who were quite
enraptured.<a name="FNA_23_05" id="FNA_23_05"></a><a href="#FN_23_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The reception of the Duke, however vociferous, can hardly
on reflection have given him much pleasure when he saw
Newcastle, Winchelsea, Wetherell, and <i>hoc genus omne</i> as
much the objects of idolatry as himself. Peel very wisely
would have nothing to do with the concern, and they
are probably very angry with him for absenting himself.
The resentment he must feel towards the University on
account of their conduct to him must afford full scope to all
the contempt these proceedings are calculated to excite.
There was a vast mob of fine people, Mrs. Arbuthnot among
the rest. The Duke made rather indifferent work of his Latin
speeches. As usual he seemed quite unconcerned at the
applause with which he was greeted; no man ever courted
that sort of distinction less.</p>

of Oxford on the 10th of June.]</p></div>

<h3>June 18th, 1834</h3>

<p>Lord Conyngham and George Byng are to be
Postmaster and a Lord of Treasury, Abercromby is to be
Master of the Mint, and Cutler Fergusson Judge Advocate,
appointments sneered and laughed at. When Althorp announced
the first in the House of Commons Hume said, &lsquo;God
bless us! is it possible?&rsquo; Some think Abercromby will be of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
use to them&mdash;that he is grave, practical, industrious, and
carries weight in the House. I am unable to discover anything
in him, except his consistency, to entitle him to any
praise. An odd thing happened to Brougham the other day.
He got a note from Althorp while he was sitting in his Court
about the insolence and violence of the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and that its
lies and abuse of the Government ought to be put a stop to
by some means. The Chancellor tore the note up, and after
finishing his business departed. Two hours after Lemarchant
got a note from the editor to say that the note had been picked
up, put together, and was in his possession. Brougham was
furious, and sent to ask the name of the person who gave it,
promising to forgive him if it was given up, and threatening
if it was not to dismiss every officer in his Court, and not to
replace any of them till the culprit was discovered.</p>

<h3>June 20th, 1834</h3>

<p>The Tories are in arms and eager for the
fray. There was a dinner of fifty at the Conservative Club
on the 18th (Waterloo day), with healths and speeches, when
Peel delivered himself of a speech half an hour long, to which
vast importance is attached. People, however, hear things,
as they see things, differently. Theodore Hook, who was
present, told me &lsquo;it was very satisfactory, a declaration of
war; that he announced his having supported the Government
while he could from a sense of duty, but that seeing
they were resolved to attack the Church, he was prepared to
act with, or lead (I forget which), any party which might be
formed upon the principle of supporting the Establishment;
that the Tories were few in numbers, but strong in character,&rsquo;
and so on. Vesey Fitzgerald, who was likewise there, said it
was no declaration of war whatever&mdash;a strong Conservative
speech, but not violent in any way, nor indicative of any intended
deviation from the course Peel has heretofore pursued.
So his acts must show which report is the more correct.
When we hear that his speech pleased Chandos and Falmouth,
one can&rsquo;t help believing it must have been somewhat fierce.
I have great confidence in Peel&rsquo;s watchful sagacity, but his
game is a very difficult one, and with all his prudence he may
make a false step. It is so much his interest to
<ins class="correction" title = "text reads &ldquo;ascertian&rdquo;">ascertain</ins>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TORY WARFARE.</span>
the real disposition of the country that I am disposed to
defer very much to his views and notions of probabilities,
otherwise I can with difficulty believe that it is wise in him
to encourage and head a High Church party and promote
the senseless cry of the Church in danger. It is the contest
itself as much as the triumph of any party that is to be
deprecated, for nothing is like the exasperation of religious
quarrels, and victory is always abused and moderation forgotten,
whichever side has the ascendant. Every day, however,
it becomes more apparent that this Government cannot
last; living as I do with men of all parties, I collect a variety
of opinions, some of them intrinsically worth little, except as
straws show which way the wind blows, but which satisfy
me that the present House of Commons has no great affection
for them, and would not have much difficulty in supporting
any other Administration that presented a respectable appearance,
and would act upon principles at once liberal and
moderate. The majority of the members dread a dissolution,
knowing that the next elections must be fiercely contested,
and be expensive and embarrassing in all ways. Altogether
it is difficult to conceive a more unsettled and unsatisfactory
state of things, nor one from which it appears more hopeless
to emerge. In the state of parties and of the country the
one thing needful&mdash;a strong Government&mdash;appears the one
thing that it is impossible to obtain.</p>

<h3>June 24th, 1834</h3>

<p>Lord Auckland told me the other night that
Government are prepared for the Dissenters Bill being thrown
out in the House of Lords, and that they don&rsquo;t care. He
thinks it never will be carried, and will be a standing
grievance of no great weight. The Chancellor made an
admirable speech on secondary punishments, connecting with
it the question of education. He told me he was called on
to pronounce an essay without any preparation, and he did
the best he could. I did not hear it, but was told it was
excellent. He shines in this sort of thing; his views are so
enlarged and philosophical, and they are expressed in such
becoming and beautiful language.</p>

<h3>June 26th, 1834</h3>

<p>There was a good debate on Monday in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
House of Commons on the Irish Tithes Bill. Peel made a
very clever speech, attacking the Commission with great
felicity, and John Russell made an excellent speech in reply,
failing to excuse the Commission, which is inexcusable, but
very good upon the question. Both he and Ellice <i>spoke out</i>.
I was at the Abbey on Tuesday and yesterday for a performance
and a rehearsal of the &lsquo;Messiah.&rsquo; The spectacle is
very fine, and it is all admirably managed&mdash;no crowd or inconvenience,
and easy egress and ingress&mdash;but the &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo;
is not so effective as I expected, not so fine as in York
Minster; the choruses are admirably performed, but the single
voices are miserable&mdash;singers of extreme mediocrity, or whose
powers are gone; old Bellamy, who was at Handel&rsquo;s commemoration
as a singing boy, Miss Stephens, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>June 27th, 1832</h3>

<p>Lord William Russell told me last night that
his brother John has frequently offered to resign, and they
never would let him; at last he said he must speak out on
this Church appropriation question, or positively he would
not stay in, so that his speech was not <i>blurted</i> out, as I supposed,
but was the result of a fixed resolution. This alters
the case as far as he is concerned, and it can&rsquo;t be denied that
he was right in thinking it better that Government should
make itself clearly understood, and that a break-up was
preferable to going on without any real cordiality or concurrence
amongst each other and the Administration an
object of suspicion to all parties. William Russell said that
Government were quite aware that Peel and the Duke could
turn them out when they would, but that they would not
know what to do next.</p>

<p>Don Carlos is coming to town to Gloucester Lodge. When
they told him the Spanish Ambassador (Miraflores) was come
to wait upon him, he replied, &lsquo;I have no Ambassador at the
Court of London.&rsquo; He will not take any money, and he will
neither relinquish his claims to the Spanish throne nor move
hand or foot in prosecuting them. &lsquo;If chance will have me
king, why let chance crown me, without my stir.&rsquo; (He was
meditating evasion at this time, and got away undiscovered
soon after.) They say he can get all the money he wants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DON CARLOS ON HIS WAY TO SPAIN.</span>
from his partisans in Spain, and that there is no lack of
wealth in the country. Strange infatuation when men will
spend their blood and their money for such a miserable
object. If he had anything like spirit, enterprise, and
courage, he would make a fine confusion in Spain, and probably
succeed; his departure from the Peninsula and taking
refuge here has not caused the war to languish in the north.
Admiral Napier is arrived, and has taken a lodging close to
him in Portsmouth. Miraflores paid a droll compliment to
Madame de Lieven the other night. She was pointing out
the various beauties at some ball, and among others Lady
Seymour, and asked him if he did not admire her. He said,
&lsquo;Elle est trop jeune, trop fraîche,&rsquo; and then, with a tender look
and squeezing her hand, &lsquo;J&rsquo;aime les femmes un peu passées.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>July 4th, 1834</h3>

<p>The other night Stanley made a fierce speech
on Irish tithes, and plainly showed that no reconciliation
between him and the Government is feasible. Last night
Littleton made a melancholy exhibition with O&rsquo;Connell.
Formerly a Minister must have resigned who cut such a
figure; now it is very different, for no matter how unfit a
man may be, it is ten to one nobody better can be found to
replace him. A more disgraceful affair never was seen; the
Tories chuckled, the Government and their friends were disgusted,
ashamed, and vexed; Durham sat under the gallery
and enjoyed the fun.</p>

<p>I was at Woolwich yesterday to see the yacht in which
the Queen is to sail to the Continent. Such luxury and
splendour, and such gorgeous preparations. She will sail
like Cleopatra down the Cydnus, and though she will have
no beautiful boys like Cupids to fan her, she will be attended
by Emily Bagot, who is as beautiful as the Mater Cupidinum.
She will return to her beggarly country in somewhat
different trim from that in which she left it, with all her
earls and countesses, equipages, pages, valets, dressers, &amp;c.
The Duke of Wellington gave a great ball the other night,
and invited all the Ministers. The Chancellor was there till
three or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and they say it was
very amusing to see the Duke doing the honours to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
The Tories have had a great disappointment in the Finsbury
election, which they fancied Pownall was sure of carrying
the first day, but Tommy Duncombe beat him hollow the
second. It is certainly a great exhibition of Radical strength
in that metropolitan district, and may serve to sober the Tories
a little, and bring some of them down from their high horses.</p>

<h3>July 6th, 1834</h3>

<p>When I wrote the above I had not read
Stanley&rsquo;s speech, and had only heard he had used very strong
language. I was greatly astonished when I did read it, and
fully concur in the nearly universal opinion that, however
clever and laughable it may have been, it was a most injudicious
and unfortunate exhibition, and is calculated to do
him a serious and lasting injury. (This was the famous
&lsquo;thimblerig&rsquo; speech.) I do not know when I have read or
heard so virulent and coarse an invective, and it is rather
disgusting than anything else to see such an one fired off at
the men with whom he has been acting for some years (up
to three weeks ago), with whom he declared his entire concurrence
on every other question, from whom he expressed
the liveliest regret at separating, and to whom he was individually
bound by the strongest ties of friendship and regard.
(It will be seen that he made similar professions when he
separated from Peel&rsquo;s Government in &rsquo;46, and instantly
rushed into a similar opposition.) The Tories cheered him
lustily; and what must he on reflection think of such cheers,
and of his position in the House&mdash;to be halloa&rsquo;d on by the
party which he has hitherto treated with the greatest contempt,
and which he thinks the very essence of bigotry and
prejudice, at least on all secular matters, against his old
friends and colleagues, to whom he is still allied in opinion
upon almost every great question of foreign or domestic
policy? He availed himself of his knowledge that there was
nobody on the Treasury Bench who could answer him to fling
out this spiteful and intemperate invective. If Brougham
could have been thrown for half an hour into the House, &lsquo;like
an eagle into a dovecot,&rsquo; what a grand opportunity there would
have been for his tremendous sarcasm to vent itself. As it
was, Stanley went away unscathed, for though Althorp was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STANLEY&rsquo;S THIMBLERIG SPEECH.</span>
not bad in the few words he said with great good-humour,
and Littleton made a very tolerable speech, the former
twaddled, and the latter has been too much damaged to allow
of his saying anything with effect; besides, he quoted a speech
of Stanley&rsquo;s against him (at all times a poor argument) and did
not quote the whole of it. I dare say Peel was not very sorry
to hear Stanley&rsquo;s speech, and justly estimated the value of the
cheers with which it was hailed. It places him at an immeasurable
distance below Peel, and puts an end to any pretensions
of rivalship, if he ever entertained any. If a junction
is to take place between them, Stanley must be content
with a subordinate part; and, act with whomsoever he may,
he will never inspire real confidence or conciliate real esteem.
I entertain this opinion with regret, and could have wished
he had cut a better figure. I dined with a Tory at the
&lsquo;Travellers&rsquo; yesterday, and he said, &lsquo;Of course we cheered
him as loudly as we could; we want to get him, but I must
own that it was a very injudicious speech and very unbecoming.&rsquo;
These are the sort of events in a man&rsquo;s life which
influence his destiny ever after; it is not that his political
career will be marred, or that anything can prevent his
talents rendering it on the whole important, and probably
successful, but there is a revulsion in men&rsquo;s minds about him,
which cannot fail to produce a silent, but in the end a sensible
effect upon his fortunes. It is remarkable that Lord
Derby, who is a very shrewd and sagacious old man, never
would hear of his grandson&rsquo;s superlative merits, and always
in the midst of his triumphs questioned his ultimate success.</p>

<h3>July 10th, 1834</h3>

<p>Came to town last night from Newmarket,
and found things in a fine state. Althorp had resigned three
days ago; his resignation was accepted, on which Lord Grey
resigned too. Both of them explained in Parliament last
night, Lord Grey, as they tell me, in a very moving and
gentlemanlike speech, admirably delivered. The Duke of
Wellington made a violent attack upon him in reply, which
it is thought he might as well have omitted. (The Duke&rsquo;s
speech gave great disgust to many even of his own party,
and was afterwards assigned as a reason by Stanley and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
his friends for not taking office with the Duke.) Nobody
knows what is to happen. The King sent for Melbourne,
and his nephew, John Ponsonby, told me last night he believed
he would endeavour to carry on the Government; but
whether he does or not it can&rsquo;t last; the Whig Government
is virtually at an end. The Tories, who were shouting
the night before last, are considerably disappointed that the
King did not instantly avail himself of Lord Grey&rsquo;s resignation
to send for them, or at least for Peel. I don&rsquo;t suppose,
however, that it is from any predilection for the Whigs that
he tries to bolster up this Government, but he is said to have
an exceeding horror of a dissolution, and it is just possible
he may be acting under some good advice surreptitiously
conveyed to him, for under all circumstances I think he is
taking the most prudent part he can. It is very essential
that he should have no hand in the dissolution of this Cabinet,
and if he does his best to reconstruct it, and gives the
remaining Ministers a fair trial, he will have a good right to
call upon the House of Commons and the country to support
him in any ulterior measures that circumstances may compel
him to adopt.</p>

<p>Thus Littleton has been the instrument of breaking up
this Government; a man powerless to serve his party has
contrived to destroy it. It is curious to trace this matter
from the outset. When Hobhouse threw up his office and
his seat, it was extremely difficult to find a successor to
him in the Irish Office, principally because not one man in
fifty could procure a seat in Parliament, or his re-election if
already there. In this emergency Littleton volunteered his
services; he was sure of his seat, and he wanted eventually a
peerage, so he wrote to Lord Grey, and said that if he
thought him capable of filling the place he would undertake
it.<a name="FNA_23_06" id="FNA_23_06"></a><a href="#FN_23_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Nothing better suggested itself; it was a way out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CAUSES OF THE RETIREMENT OF LORD GREY.</span>
difficulty, and they closed with his offer. No man could
be less fit for such a situation; his talents are slender, his
manners unpopular, and his vanity considerable. When
warned against O&rsquo;Connell he said, &lsquo;Oh, leave me to manage
Dan,&rsquo; and manage him he did with a vengeance, and a pretty
Tartar he caught. His first attempts at management were
exhibited in the business of Baron Smith. When the Coercion
question came to be agitated, he thought himself very
cunning in beginning a little intrigue without the knowledge
of his colleagues, and he wrote to Lord Wellesley for the
purpose of prevailing upon him to recommend to the Cabinet
that the Bill should pass without the strong clauses, and
most unaccountably Lord Wellesley did
so.<a name="FNA_23_07" id="FNA_23_07"></a><a href="#FN_23_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
He stated
that this omission was desirable on account of circumstances
connected with the Government in England, and
Lord Wellesley replied that if it was necessary on that
account he would contrive to manage matters without the
clauses. Upon this he put himself in communication with
O&rsquo;Connell, and never doubting that his and Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s
advice (in accordance as it was with the opinions of certain
members of this Cabinet) would prevail, he gave O&rsquo;Connell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
those expectations the disappointment of which produced
the scene between them in the House of Commons. Lord
Grey, however, was equally astonished and dissatisfied with
this last recommendation of Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s, which was
directly at variance with the opinion he had given some
time before, and he accordingly asked him to explain why
he had changed his mind, and requested him to reconsider
his latter opinion. He still replied that if it was necessary,
he would do without the clauses. Upon this there was
a discussion in the Cabinet, and Althorp, Grant, Ellice,
Abercromby, and Rice were in a minority, who, however, ultimately
gave in to the majority. All this time Littleton went
on negotiating with
O&rsquo;Connell,<a name="FNA_23_08" id="FNA_23_08"></a><a href="#FN_23_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
having told Althorp alone
that he was doing so, though not telling him all that passed,
and neither of them telling Lord Grey. Upon the <i>blow-up</i>
which O&rsquo;Connell made, Althorp very unnecessarily resolved to
resign, and when he did Lord Grey followed his example.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_23_06" id="FN_23_06"></a><a href="#FNA_23_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[This statement, though doubtless current at the time, is to my
certain knowledge entirely inaccurate. Mr. Littleton was confined to his
sofa at the time by an accident, and knew little of what was going on.
Nobody was more surprised than himself to receive from Lord Grey a
spontaneous and unexpected offer of the Chief Secretaryship of Ireland.
He was fully aware of the extreme difficulties of the office, which was at that
moment perhaps the most important in the Government. With equal
modesty and candour he distrusted his own ability to fill it, and he still
more distrusted his own want of caution and prudence, which was his weak
point. He accepted it, however, to relieve the Government from embarrassment,
but he accompanied his acceptance with a declaration to Lord Grey
that he would gladly resign his office whenever a better man could be found
to fill it. It had previously been offered to Mr. Abercromby, who refused to
accept it without a seat in the Cabinet.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_23_07" id="FN_23_07"></a><a href="#FNA_23_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[These details are also far from accurate, as has now been demonstrated
by the publication (1872) of Lord Hatherton&rsquo;s own memoir on the
subject, and of the original correspondence, which proves that the letter to
Lord Wellesley was written at the instigation of the Lord Chancellor, and
that it expressed the deliberate opinions of several members of the Cabinet.
It must, however, be acknowledged that it was written without the knowledge
of Lord Grey and in opposition to his views. The subsequent communication
made by Mr. Littleton to O&rsquo;Connell was made with the knowledge
and concurrence of Lord Althorp, though Mr. Littleton said more to
O&rsquo;Connell than Lord Althorp had intended&mdash;an indiscretion which Mr.
Littleton himself admitted: but O&rsquo;Connell made a very base and ungenerous
use of the confidence which had been extended to him.]</p></div>

[Mr. Littleton had but one conversation with O&rsquo;Connell.]</p></div>

<p>The Tories have been mighty cock-a-hoop, but their joy
is a good deal damped within the last twelve hours, for it is
now universally believed that Althorp will be prevailed upon
to remain, and will himself be at the head of the Government.
His popularity is so great in the House of Commons,
and there is such a dread of a dissolution, that if this
arrangement takes place they will scramble on some time
longer, and at this advanced period of the session it may be
doubted whether the House of Lords will throw out any
of their essential measures. I met Duncannon, Ellice, and
John Russell this evening riding, and they seemed in very
good spirits. I have no doubt Ellice and Duncannon have
had a main hand in all this business, and that they urged
on Littleton to do what he did. The House was adjourned
till Monday, to afford time for the new arrangement.
Brougham spoke like a maniac last night, and his statements
were at direct variance with Althorp&rsquo;s, the latter
declaring that they were all out and the former that they
were all still in office, and that Grey and Althorp had alone
resigned.</p>

<h3>July 12th, 1834</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POPULARITY OF LORD ALTHORP.</span>
I went out of town yesterday morning, and
did not return till seven o&rsquo;clock; in the meantime affairs
were materially altered. I met Duncannon riding with a
face as long as the pictures of Hudibras, which at once told
the tale of baffled hopes. Melbourne&rsquo;s negotiation had
failed entirely. &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo;<a name="FNA_23_09" id="FNA_23_09"></a><a href="#FN_23_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
who was backed at even against the
field the night before in the House of Commons, would have
nothing to say to it. I have not yet heard in detail the circumstances
of this failure, but it will probably turn out that
the King insisted upon some Conservative conditions, or an
attempt at coalition, which is a favourite plan of his. Yesterday
it was generally expected that Peel would be sent for,
or the Duke of Wellington. Peel called at Apsley House
and was with the Duke a long time yesterday, and afterwards,
as the Duke rode through the Park, Ellice, who was
sitting on his horse talking to Sir Edward Kerrison, said,
&lsquo;There goes a man who knows more than he did an hour ago.&rsquo;
It is expected that Peel, if called upon, will endeavour to
form and carry on a Government; but opinions are greatly
divided as to the support he would get in the House of
Commons, and as to the effect of a dissolution, should he be
driven to adopt that hazardous alternative. I think that
almost everything depends upon the course which Althorp
takes, as far as the rest of this session is concerned. His
popularity in the House of Commons is very great, and even
surprising; it is a proof of the influence which personal
character may obtain when unadorned with great abilities
and shining parts; his remarkable <i>bonhommie</i>, unalterable
good nature and good temper, the conviction of his honesty
and sincerity, and of his want of ambition, his single-mindedness,
his unfeigned desire to get out of the trammels and
cares of office, have all combined to procure for him greater
personal regard, and to a certain degree greater influence,
than any Minister ever possessed in my recollection. There
is no such feeling as animosity against Althorp. Some
detest his principles, some despise his talents, but none
detest or despise the man; and he is said by those who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
judges of such matters to have one talent, and that is a
thorough knowledge of the House of Commons and great
quickness and tact in discovering the bias and disposition of
the House. If Althorp abstains from any rough opposition,
and endeavours to restrain others, upon the principle of giving
a fair trial to those who may have taken his place because he
would not continue to hold it, it is probable that the majority
will avail themselves of such an opportunity for avoiding a dissolution,
and give a sulky and suspicious assent to the measures
of the new Ministry, for a cordial support cannot be
expected. This, however, must depend upon circumstances
which are still <i>in nubibus</i>. To-day must, in all probability,
decide who is to attempt the task of forming a Government.
Stanley, it is supposed, if invited, will not join Peel, at least
not at present; all, however, is speculation, curiosity, and
excitement.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_23_09" id="FN_23_09"></a><a href="#FNA_23_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[The cant name given at the time to John, Lord Althorp.]</p></div>

<h3>July 13th, 1834</h3>

<p>All yesterday nothing was done; the King
remains very quietly at Windsor, still in communication
with Melbourne, and I believe with the Chancellor. He
declines talking upon the present state of affairs to anybody.
What he wanted was, that some attempt should be made
towards a coalition, but this the remaining Ministers would
not consent to. Poulett Thomson called on me at my office
in the afternoon, and told me that it was by no means true
that Althorp would not on any terms take the Government;
but that he would not unless he had <i>carte blanche</i>, in which
case he could not refuse it; if he did refuse, Thomson added,
that everybody ought to support Peel or <i>any Tory</i> Government.
He is convinced that if Peel took the Government
he would be driven out by the House of Commons <i>instanter</i>,
unless he could show that he had done so in consequence of
the King being deserted by the present men. I afterwards
met Mulgrave, who had been riding with Althorp, who told
him that though it would be very disagreeable to him on
every account, and especially as regards Lord Grey, he
might have it put to him in a way that left him no
option. Lord Grey and his friends and family think that he
has been extremely ill-used, and they are indignant with all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD GREY AND STANLEY.</span>
the actors in the Littleton affair, and only burning with
desire to expose those who are still concealed. Charles Grey
talked to me for half an hour in the lobby of the Opera
House last night, and said that Lord Wellesley ought to
disclose all that was still secret in the transaction, and produce
the private letters he had received from England, and
by which his opinions and advice had been influenced.
Such letters they know were written, and they believe by the
Chancellor; this belief, whether it turns out to be true or
false, is, I perceive, very general. It is inconceivable what a
reputation that man has, and how universally he is distrusted,
and despised as much as anybody with such great
abilities can be. His political character is about on a par
with Whittle Harvey&rsquo;s moral character; his insolence and
swaggering, bullying tone in the House of Lords have
excited as much disgust out of the House as they have given
offence in it, and the only excuse for him is&mdash;what many
people believe&mdash;that there is a taint of madness about him.
The other night, in his reply to the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s violent
and foolish speech, he chose to turn upon Lord Rolle, a
very old man and a choleric, hard-bitten old Tory. Rolle was
greatly exasperated, and after he sat down went up to him
on the Woolsack and said, &lsquo;My Lord, I wish you to know
that I have the greatest contempt for you both in this House
and out of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>While Lord Grey has been very indignant against the
plotters in his Cabinet he has been sorely wounded by
the seceders, or rather by the chief of them, Stanley; but
this has been all made up in a way soothing enough to
his feelings, but not advantageous, though not discreditable,
to Stanley. The latter wrote a letter to Lord Grey expressing
his deep regret at having said anything to offend
him, disclaiming the slightest intention of the kind, pouring
forth the warmest protestations of gratitude, veneration,
and attachment to him, and finishing by an assurance that
he would take office under nobody else. After the gross
attack he made it is honourable in him to make such an
apology, but it only enhances the folly of his former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
conduct to find himself placed under the necessity of
writing a penitential letter. Lord Grey replied in corresponding
terms, and he says they shall be as good friends
again as ever, and that Stanley&rsquo;s speech shall henceforward
be forgotten; but it will be very long before the effect
produced by it will be forgotten, or that the recollection of
it will cease to have an influence on Stanley&rsquo;s reputation
and prospects. His especial friends, the other seceders,
were as much annoyed at it as anybody; and the Duchess
of Richmond told me that her husband regretted it very
bitterly. It is but justice to Richmond to own that he
has acted a fair, open, and manly part in this business,
and has satisfied all parties. Lord Grey was not annoyed
at what passed between them in the House of Lords, and
their friendship has never suffered any interruption.</p>

<h3>July 15th, 1834</h3>

<p>This interval of feverish anxiety has ended
by the formation of the Administration being entrusted to
Lord Melbourne. He refused to undertake it unless Althorp
could stay with him. The King wanted Lord Grey to come
back, and spoke to Taylor about it, but he told him it was out
of the question, and therefore the King did not propose it, but
he has constantly written to him in the most flattering terms,
and desired he might be consulted in every step of these
proceedings. Lord Grey has acted very cordially towards
Melbourne, and pressed Althorp so earnestly to stay that he
has consented, and last night the announcements were made
to the two Houses. The Tories (the High and foolish) are
down in the mouth, but Peel is himself well content not to
have been mixed up in the concern. The present conjecture
is that Abercromby will go to the Home Office and Durham
to Ireland. Nobody thinks the Government will last long,
and everybody &lsquo;wonders&rsquo; how Melbourne will do it. He
is certainly a queer fellow to be Prime Minister, and he
and Brougham are two wild chaps to have the destinies of
this country in their hands. I should not be surprised if
Melbourne was to rouse his dormant energies and be excited
by the greatness of his position to display the vigour and
decision in which he is not deficient. Unfortunately his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD DUNCANNON HOME SECRETARY.</span>
reputation is not particularly good; he is considered lax in
morals, indifferent in religion, and very loose and pliant in
politics. He is supposed to have consented to measures
of which he disapproved because it suited his ease and convenience
to do so, and because he was actuated by no strong
political principles or opinions.</p>

<h3>July 17th, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday it was announced that Duncannon
is to be Secretary of State and called to the House of Peers;
Hobhouse in his place and in the Cabinet, and to stand for
Nottingham. This completes the concern; Duncannon
Secretary of State! Who could ever have thought of him
in such a station? His proper element seemed to be the
House of Commons, where he was a bustling, zealous partisan
and a very good whipper-in; but he cannot speak at all, and
though a tolerably candid talker, his capacity is slender; he
has no pretensions of any sort to a high office, and nothing
but peculiar circumstances could put him in one; but the
difficulty has been how to deal with Durham, for the majority
of the Cabinet were decided upon having nothing to do with
him, although there were some few who wanted to take him
in. By I know not what process of reasoning they arrived
at the conclusion that Duncannon&rsquo;s elevation was the only
solution of this difficulty, but so it is, for I believe he would
have preferred to stay in his old place. They are all in
raptures with the King, and with his straightforward dealing
on this occasion. In the first instance he desired Melbourne
to write to the Duke, Peel, and Stanley, stating his wish that
an Administration should be formed upon a wide and comprehensive
plan. He wrote accordingly to each, and with his
letters he sent copies of his own letter to the King, in which
he gave his opinion that the formation of such a Government
was impossible. The Duke and Peel each replied, with expressions
of duty, to his Majesty, that they agreed with
Lord Melbourne, but did not see any necessity for giving
reasons for their opinions. The King, however, desired to
have their reasons, which have since been sent to him by
them. Stanley wrote a long letter, with a peremptory
refusal to form part of any such Government. He appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
anxious to pacify the Whigs by disclaiming any intention
of connecting himself with the Tories. Though all the Grey
family are very indignant, and by no means silent, at the way
the Earl has been treated, he has behaved with great temper
and forbearance, and has lent his old colleagues his cordial
assistance in patching up the broken concern.</p>

<h3>July 19th, 1834</h3>

<p>Two angry debates in the Lords last night
and the night before; I was present at the last, but not at the
first. On Thursday Lord Wicklow made a virulent attack on
the Government; the Duke of Buckingham was coarse, the
Chancellor rabid, and a disgraceful scene of confusion and
disorder arose. Melbourne made his first speech, declaration,
and explanation, and is thought to have done it very
well&mdash;a good beginning. Last night Wharncliffe moved for
the production of Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s letter, by which the
opinion of the Cabinet had been shaken about the Coercion
Bill. Lord Grey made a very handsome speech indeed,
throwing his shield over his old colleagues, declaring he
neither complained nor had he been ill-used, and entreated
that the new Government might be fairly tried, and not embarrassed
without cause in the outset. It was certainly the
speech of a thorough gentleman, but the case is after all a bad
one. The dates show what must have happened. It was on
the 20th of June that Mr. Littleton told O&rsquo;Connell there was a
discussion going on in the Cabinet, and that the Coercion Bill
was not yet settled. Now on the 20th of June it <i>was</i> settled,
but on the 23rd of June came Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s letter, which
unsettled it.<a name="FNA_23_10" id="FNA_23_10"></a><a href="#FN_23_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
It is clear, then, that a communication was made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">O&rsquo;CONNELL AND THE COERCION BILL.</span>
to Lord Wellesley which it was confidently expected would
elicit from him such a letter as would enable the authors of
the communication to revive the discussion, and Littleton, not
being able to wait for its arrival, anticipated it, and told
O&rsquo;Connell that the discussion was begun before the cause of
it was in operation. There certainly never was a more
complete underhand intrigue perpetrated than this, and
although no official document, or demi-official will now be
produced to reveal the name of the prime mover, everybody&rsquo;s
finger is pointed at Brougham, and the young Greys
make no secret of their conviction that he is the man.
But undoubtedly the greatest evil resulting from the proceedings
and the termination of them (in the reconstruction of
this Government, with its additions, and the alteration of
the Bill) is the vast increase which must be made to the power
and authority of O&rsquo;Connell. He has long been able to make
the Irish believe anything he pleases, and he will certainly
have no difficulty in persuading them that he himself has
brought about this state of things, that he has ousted Lord
Grey, introduced Duncannon (who of all the Whigs has been
his greatest friend), and expunged the obnoxious clauses from
the Coercion Bill, and the fact is that all this is not very far
from the truth. Between his dexterity in availing himself
of circumstances and his betrayal of Littleton, between the
folly of some men and the baseness of others, he has appeared
the most prominent character in the drama. Even now I
cannot make out <i>why</i> everybody wished the Bill to be thus
emasculated, for there would have been no difficulty in passing
it through both Houses. To the surprise of everybody
Littleton is suffered to keep his place, probably by the
protection of Althorp, who may have been as dogged about
him on this occasion as he was about the Speakership, and
as he is considered (on account of his character) so indispensable
in the House of Commons, of course he can make
his own terms.<a name="FNA_23_11" id="FNA_23_11"></a><a href="#FN_23_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_23_10" id="FN_23_10"></a><a href="#FNA_23_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[This again is not accurate. It was on the 23rd of June, <i>after</i> the
arrival of Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s letter, that Mr. Littleton saw O&rsquo;Connell. The
question was still under discussion on that day, and the opinions of different
members of the Cabinet were much divided. Those Ministers (including the
Chancellor) who were opposed to the renewal of the Coercion Bill in its integrity
wished to secure the assent of Lord Wellesley to their views. After
the receipt of Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s letter of the 21st of June both Lord Melbourne
and Lord Althorp declared that &lsquo;it was impossible to ask Parliament for an
unconstitutional power which the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland had been led
to disclaim.&rsquo; (See Hatherton&rsquo;s Memoir, p. 13.) The question was not finally
settled till the Cabinet of the 20th of June. Mr. Littleton had been distinctly
informed by Lord Althorp, on the same day that he saw O&rsquo;Connell, that
the matter was not settled, and that he (Lord Althorp) would resign
rather than allow the disputed clauses to form part of the new Bill.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_23_11" id="FN_23_11"></a><a href="#FNA_23_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
[This was so. Lord Althorp positively refused to hold office in the
Melbourne Government, unless Mr. Littleton could be prevailed upon to
resume and retain his office as Irish Secretary. Nothing could be more
honourable to both parties than this conduct of Lord Althorp; but it was
due to the fact that he had himself been a party to the communication made
by Mr. Littleton to O&rsquo;Connell, and that he knew Mr. Littleton had been
exposed to more censure than he deserved.]</p></div>

<h3>July 20th, 1834</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
At Court yesterday to swear in Duncannon
Secretary of State. He told me he had made
Stanley<a name="FNA_23_12" id="FNA_23_12"></a><a href="#FN_23_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
(the
man they call Sir Benjamin Backbite, and familiarly Ben)
his under-secretary, telling him he must speak, for that he
(Duncannon) could not. Auckland and Duncannon will not
certainly add much to the oratorical splendour of the Government.
Ellice was there, and told me about a grand case the
Tories have got hold of against him, growing out of Lord
Western&rsquo;s evidence in Whittle Harvey&rsquo;s Committee. It there
came out that Western had applied to Ellice, then Secretary
of the Treasury (at the time of the great Reform election),
for money to assist at the Colchester election, and he sent 500&#8467;.
They want to make out that this was public money, but they
won&rsquo;t catch him. He says several individuals subscribed
large sums, which were placed at his disposal to be employed
to the best advantage for the cause. He will get out of it.
He talked of the Government, said it was a great error to
suppose it was inclined to <i>movement</i> principles, and that in
point of fact there was very little difference, except on Church
matters, between Sir Robert Peel and himself, that there
never was so good a House of Commons for the Government,
that in all this mess&mdash;for mess it was&mdash;the Tories could not
succeed in getting up a feeling or a prejudice against the
Government, and it was clear they were utterly powerless
there, that the House only required to be a little cajoled, and
was easily led; the word Reform was still potent there, and
had only to be uttered on occasions to bring the majority
round when they began to show a refractory disposition.</p>

<h3>July 21st, 1834</h3>

<p>The Chancellor and the Hollands urged Lord
Grey to take the Privy Seal. This Sefton told me as a great
secret yesterday, but the indignation of the Greys burst
through all restraint, and they told it &lsquo;à qui voulait les
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD MELBOURNE&rsquo;S ADMINISTRATION.</span>
entendre,&rsquo; with every expression of rage and disgust, &lsquo;adding
insult to injury.&rsquo; Lord Grey was more philosophical, and
rather smiled at the proposition, but he did not repress the
pious resentment of his children. The Grey women would
murder the Chancellor if they could. It certainly was a
curious suggestion. The Hollands think of nothing on earth
but how they may best keep the Duchy of Lancaster, and
they fancied Lord Grey&rsquo;s holding the Privy Seal might be of
service to the Government, and if they could make him commit
such a <i>bassesse</i> so much the better. It is not always easy
to discover the Chancellor&rsquo;s motives, but as he is as vindictive
as he is false and tricking, he perhaps took this opportunity
of revenging himself for the old offer of the Attorney-Generalship,
which he has never forgiven.<a name="FNA_23_13" id="FNA_23_13"></a><a href="#FN_23_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

[This view of the case is certainly unjust to Lord Brougham, who had
more respect and regard for Lord Grey than for any other statesman of the
time, as his correspondence with the Earl, now recently published in
Brougham&rsquo;s &lsquo;Posthumous Memoirs&rsquo; sufficiently proves.]</p>

<h3>August 5th, 1834</h3>

<p>At Goodwood for the races, so read nothing
except half of Jacquemont&rsquo;s Letters and a little book I picked
up, the &lsquo;History of the Grand Vizier Coprogli;&rsquo; called to
town on Wednesday last for a Council, to swear in Mulgrave
Privy Seal; went to Petworth on my way for one night.
Stanley was at Goodwood, absorbed in racing, billiards, and
what not; nobody would have guessed that all this rough and
rustic gaiety covered ambition, eloquence, and powers which
must make him one of the most eminent men, though his
reputation is not what it was.</p>

<p>While I was there news came of Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s death.
He was a very amiable man and with a good understanding,
though his talents were far from brilliant, a High Churchman
and a High Tory, but a cool politician, a bad speaker,
a good writer, greatly averse to changes, but unwillingly
acquiescing in many. He was nervous and reserved, with a
good deal of humour, and habitually a jester. His conversation
was generally a series of jokes, and he rarely discussed
any subject but in a ludicrous vein. His conduct to Napoleon
justly incurred odium, for although he was only one of many,
he was the Minister through whom the orders of Government
passed, and he suffered the principal share of the reproach
which was thrown upon the Cabinet for their rude and
barbarous treatment of the Emperor at St. Helena. He had
not a lively imagination, and his feelings were not excited
by the contemplation of such a striking example of fallen
greatness. I was Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s private secretary for
several years, but so far from feeling any obligation to him,
I always consider his mistaken kindness in giving me that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
post as the source of all my misfortunes and the cause of
my present condition. He never thought fit to employ me,
never associated me with the interests and the business of
his office, and consequently abandoned me at the age of
eighteen to that life of idleness and dissipation from which
I might have been saved had he felt that my future prospects
in life, my character and talents, depended in great measure
upon the direction which was at that moment given to my
mind. He would probably have made me a Tory (which I
should hardly have remained), but I should have become a
man of business, and of the antagonist tastes which divided
my mind that for literature and employment would have got
the better of that for amusement and idleness, instead, as
unfortunately happened, of the latter prevailing over the
former. Though I knew Lord Bathurst so long, and was his
private secretary for some years, and his family and mine
have always been so intimate, I had no real intimacy with
him. From what I have learnt from others I am disposed
to rate his abilities more highly than the world has done.
He was the friend and devoted admirer of Pitt, and a regular
Tory of the old school, who felt that evil days had come upon
him in his old age. When he left office with the Duke of
Wellington he resolved upon finally quitting public life, and
let what might happen, never to take office again. On coming
to town yesterday I heard of another death&mdash;Mrs. Arbuthnot,
after a short illness. The Duke of Wellington, with whom
she had lived in the most intimate relations for many years,
evinced a good deal of feeling, but he is accused of insensibility
because he had the good taste and sense to smooth his brow
and go to the House of Lords with a cheerful aspect. She
was not a clever woman, but she was neither dull nor deficient,
and very prudent and silent.</p>

<h3>August 6th, 1834</h3>

<p>To my office, then to the House of Lords
and heard a discussion on foreign politics; not very amusing;
Melbourne not so good as Grey would have been. The Duke
spoke, but he looked very ill. Walked from the House with
Lord Carnarvon, who is an intelligent man, but a great
alarmist and very desponding; he thinks we are going on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRISH TITHE BILL.</span>
step by step to an utter subversion of all interests and institutions.</p>

<h3>August 7th, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday I met the Duke of Wellington,
who talked to me of Mrs. Arbuthnot; I walked away from
my office with Duncannon, who told me that O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s
amendment in the Tithe Bill met with his concurrence (and
in fact, though he did not exactly say as much, his connivance).
He said he was sure this Bill was the only chance
for the Irish Church, which he was very anxious to save
and support; expressed great anxiety to make it up with
O&rsquo;Connell by giving him a great judicial situation, is convinced
he is sincere (at the moment) in all he says, but that
he is so vain and excitable and ambitious that when he returns
to Ireland he forgets all he has promised or professed;
the demon of agitation regains the ascendant, and he bursts
into all those excesses which have made him so odious and
formidable; but there is no chance of any arrangement with
him, for the majority of the Government would not hear of
it. I dined at the &lsquo;Travellers;&rsquo; walked to a fire in Edward
Street, where I amused myself with the strange figures and
groups, the glare, bustle, and noise. There was Duncannon
again, a Secretary of State jostling and jostled in the mob.</p>

<h3>August 12th, 1834</h3>

<p>On Saturday to Hillingdon, and back yesterday;
passed the night at the House of Lords, to hear the
debate on the Irish Tithe
Bill.<a name="FNA_24_01" id="FNA_24_01"></a><a href="#FN_24_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
At a meeting at Apsley
House the Tory Lords came to an unanimous resolution to
throw out the Bill, and at one or two meetings at Lambeth
the bishops agreed to do the same. The debate was heavy;
Melbourne very unlike Lord Grey, whose forte was leading
the House of Lords and making speeches on such occasions.
Ellenborough spoke the best, I think. I hardly ever heard
such unbroken fluency, and a good deal of <i>stuff</i>, too, in his
speech. Ellice and Spring Rice both told me that this
decision was the most fatal and most important that had
occurred for years; the latter said that no tithe would be
paid, but that there would be no <i>active</i> resistance. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
tithe property as could be seized would not be sold, because
there would be no purchasers for it. One thing is clear to
me, that those Tories who are always bellowing &lsquo;revolution&rsquo;
and &lsquo;spoliation,&rsquo; and who talk of the gradual subversion of
every institution and the imminent peril in which all our
establishments are placed, do not really believe one word of
what they say, and, instead of being oppressed with fear,
they are buoyed up with delusive confidence and courage;
for if they did indeed believe that the Church&mdash;the Church
of Ireland especially&mdash;was in danger, and that its preservation
was the one paramount desideratum, they would
gladly avert, as far as they might, that danger by a compromise
involving a very small (if any) sacrifice of principle,
and which would secure to the Irish clergy, as far as human
prudence, legislative sanction, and the authority of law can
secure it, a permanent and a competent provision, free from
the danger and the odium which have for a long time past
embittered the existence of every clergyman in the country.
It is a curious speculation to see what the effect will be of
this vote practically in Ireland on the condition of the clergy,
and upon public opinion here.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_24_01" id="FN_24_01"></a><a href="#FNA_24_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[The Irish Tithe Bill was thrown out by the House of Lords by 189
to 122.]</p></div>

<p>It is difficult to understand why the Lords did not alter
the Bill in Committee and restore it to its original state,
that which Ellenborough said he would not have opposed,
and which had been already sanctioned by a great majority
of the House of Commons upon the report of a Committee.
If they had done this, either the Bill must have passed in
this less obnoxious shape or the odium of its rejection would
have been thrown upon the Commons, and the Lords would
undoubtedly have had an excellent case to present to the
country. But if there is a wall they are sure to run their
heads against it, and if there is none they build one up for
the purpose. What puzzles me most is the opposition of the
clergy; they are the parties most immediately and most
deeply interested in this Bill, and yet the great majority of
them appear to be opposed <i>totis viribus</i> to it.</p>

<h3>August 13th, 1834</h3>

<p>Dined at Roehampton yesterday with
Farquhar. Mrs. Norton and Mrs. Blackwood and Theodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THEODORE HOOK.</span>
Hook dined there among others. After dinner he displayed
his extraordinary talent of improvisation, which I had never
heard but once before, and then he happened not to be in
the vein. Last night he was very brilliant. Each lady
gave him a subject, such as the &lsquo;Goodwood Cup,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Tithe
Bill;&rsquo; one &lsquo;could not think of anything,&rsquo; when he dashed
off and sang stanzas innumerable, very droll, with ingenious
rhymes and excellent hits, &lsquo;his eye begetting occasion for
his excellent wit,&rsquo; for at every word of interruption or admiration,
every look or motion, he indulged in a digression,
always coming back to one of the themes imposed upon him.
It is a <i>tour de force</i>, in which I believe he stands alone, and it
is certainly wonderfully well worth hearing and uncommonly
amusing.</p>

<h3>August 14th, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday there was a bother with the
Chancellor about Lord Westmeath&rsquo;s case pending before the
Privy
Council.<a name="FNA_24_02" id="FNA_24_02"></a><a href="#FN_24_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
He took it into his head (probably having
been got at by Lady Westmeath or some of her friends) to
have it decided forthwith, and sent to desire a Committee
might be convened. Westmeath&rsquo;s counsel was out of town;
Follett, whom he relies on, is on the Northern Circuit, but his
other counsel is to be had, being at Chislehurst. Accordingly
the Chancellor desired that the case might stand over from
Thursday, the day he first appointed it (giving only two
days&rsquo; notice), to Monday, and that it should be notified to
the parties that if they did not then appear the case should
go on without them. Westmeath came to me in a frenzy of
rage, and said the Chancellor was the greatest of villains, and
so he would tell him in the House of Lords or in the Privy
Council. I begged him to hold his tongue, and I would
speak to the Chancellor. So I went to the House of Lords
where he was sitting, and told Lemarchant what had passed,
and that the case ought not to be thus hurried on. He
thanked me very much, and said he would go to Brougham;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
but he soon returned, and said that the Chancellor would
hear nothing, and would have the case brought on, and he
therefore advised me not to give myself any further concern
in it, and to leave him and Westmeath to settle it as they
might. In the meantime Westmeath went down to the
House of Lords, and after speaking to Wynford, whom the
Chancellor had asked to attend (as he learnt from me), was
going to get up in the House of Lords and attack him, and
was only prevented by Wynford dragging him down by the
tail of his coat. I had already spoken to Wynford, and I afterwards
spoke to Lord Lansdowne, telling them that the case
ought not to be hurried on in this peremptory way, and I
persuaded Lord Lansdowne to set his face against it. However,
in the meantime Wynford had urged the Chancellor to
put it off, and not exasperate that madman, who would say
or do something violent; and, whether from reason or fear,
he prevailed on him. Wynford told me that Brougham is
undoubtedly mad, and so I really believe he is. While I
was in the House of Lords Horne came in from the Commons,
and said they had succeeded in stifling there all
discussion on the rejection of the Tithe Bill by the House
of Lords. Grattan was going to introduce the subject, but
was prevailed on to say nothing, and to some questions put
by Major Beauclerck Althorp refused to reply.</p>

[The appellate jurisdiction in causes matrimonial was vested at this
time in the King in Council. The case of Westmeath <i>v.</i> Westmeath, which
was a suit for a separation and a question of alimony, came up on appeal
from the Court of Arches.]</p></div>

<h3>August 16th, 1834</h3>

<p>At a Council for the prorogation; the first
time I have seen all these new Ministers in a bunch&mdash;a
queer set, all things considered, to be in possession of the
Palace. Great change of decoration. Duncannon, Ellice,
Hobhouse, Abercromby, Mulgrave, Auckland. The King,
who is fond of meddling in the Council business instead of
repeating like a parrot what is put in his mouth, made a
bother and confusion about a fancy matter, and I was forced
to go to Taylor and beg to explain it to him, which I did
after the House of Lords. The King was quite knocked up
and easily satisfied, for he neither desired nor could have
understood any explanations. There were not much more
than half a dozen Peers in the House, but many ladies.
The Chancellor went down, and, in presence of the ladies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM.</span>
attired in his golden robes (and especially before Mrs. P., to
whom he makes love), gave a judgment in some case in
which a picture of Nell Gwynne was concerned, and he was
very proud of the <i>delicacy</i> of his judgment. There never was
anything like his exhilaration of spirits and good-humour.
I don&rsquo;t know what has come to him, except it be that he
has scrambled through the session and got Lord Grey out.
He wound up in the House of Lords by the introduction of
his Bill for a Judicial Committee there, which he prefaced by
a speech exhibiting his own judicial acts, and undoubtedly
making a capital case for himself as to diligence and despatch
if it be all true (which I see no reason to doubt), and
passing a great eulogium upon the House of Lords as an
institution, and drawing comparisons between that House
and the House of Commons (much to the disadvantage of the
latter), expressing many things which are very true and
just and of a highly conservative tendency. He is a strange
being whom, with all his inconsistencies, one cannot but
admire; so varied and prodigious are his powers. Much
more are these lines applicable to him than to his predecessor
on the Woolsack:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0">
In a speech the other night, by way of putting his audience
on a wrong scent with regard to his correspondence with
Lord Wellesley, he assured them that that correspondence
was on any subject but politics, and in every language except
English; and Lemarchant told somebody that his most
difficult employment was to correct and copy out the Chancellor&rsquo;s
Greek epigrams to Lord Wellesley, his Greek characters
being worse than his English; while Lord Wellesley
sent him very neatly written and prettily composed
epigrams in return. I should think Lemarchant&rsquo;s occupation
very amusing, and that no study could be more curious
than that of the mind and actions of this strange specimen
of humanity.</p>

<h3>August 19th, 1834</h3>

<p>At Stoke from Saturday, the 16th, till yesterday;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
had much talk with old Creevey about the Chancellor.
Sefton, his great ally, so resented his conduct to Lord Grey
that he was on the point of quarrelling with him, and
Brougham miscalculated so far as to chuckle to Sefton himself
over the improvement of his own position in the new
order of things, telling him that he could more easily <i>manage</i>
Melbourne than he could Lord Grey. They are a precious
set with their squabbles and <i>tracasseries</i>. It appears that
they very well knew what Brougham was from the beginning,
especially Grey&rsquo;s womankind, who warned their father against
him, but they all flattered themselves they had taken the
sting out of him by getting him into the House of Lords.
Creevey says that Brougham is devoured with ambition, and
what he wants is to be Prime Minister, but that it is quite
impossible he should for ever escape detection and not be
regularly <i>blown up</i> sooner or later. He now wants to appear
on good terms with Lord Grey, and there is a dinner
at Edinburgh in contemplation (at which Brougham is to
preside) to be given to Lord Grey. His friends want him
not to go, but he has a notion that the Scotch have behaved
so well to him that he ought not to refuse the invitation.
The Chancellor had intended to go junketting on the Rhine
with Mrs. P., and this project was only marred by his discovering
that he could not leave the country without putting
the Great Seal in commission at a cost (to himself) of 1,400&#8467;.
This was a larger price than he was disposed to pay for his
trip, so he went off to Brougham instead.</p>

<p>On Sunday I went all over the private apartments of
Windsor Castle, and walked through what they call the
slopes to the Queen&rsquo;s cottage; all very splendid and luxurious.
In the gallery there is a model of a wretched-looking
dog-hole of a building, with a ruined tower beside it. I
asked what this was, and the housekeeper said, &lsquo;The Château
of Meiningen;&rsquo; put there, I suppose, to enhance by comparison
the pleasure of all the grandeur which surrounds the
Queen, for it would hardly have been exhibited as a philosophical
or moral memento of her humble origin and the low
fortune from which she has been raised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SPENCER PERCEVAL.</span>
As I rode into London yesterday morning I fell in with
Spencer Perceval, and got off my horse to walk into town
with him. He talks rationally enough till he gets on religious
topics; he asked me what I thought of the state of
affairs, and, after telling him my opinion of the condition
and prospects of the Church, I asked him what he thought
of them. He said he agreed with me as to the <i>status</i>, but
his notion was &lsquo;that it all proceeded from a departure from
God,&rsquo; that ours was a backsliding Church, and that God had
forsaken it, and that we had only to put our trust in Him,
and rely entirely on Him, and He would work out the salvation
of His own. We parted in the midst of the discussion,
and before I had any time to get from him any explanation
of the course he would recommend to those who govern in
furtherance of his own theocratical principles.</p>

<p>There has been what is called &lsquo;a great Protestant meeting&rsquo;
at Dublin, at which Winchilsea was introduced to the
Irish Orangemen and made one of them. It was great in
one way, for there were a great many fools, who talked a
great deal of nonsense and evinced a disposition to do a
great deal of mischief if they can. Winchilsea&rsquo;s description
of himself was undoubtedly true, only it is true always and
of all of them, &lsquo;that his feelings were so excited that he was
deprived of what little intellect he possessed.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>August 26th, 1834</h3>

<p>On Friday to Hillingdon, Saturday to
Stoke; Lord John Russell, Medem, Dedel, Tommy Duncombe,
D&rsquo;Orsay. Lord John and I walked to Bulstrode on Sunday;
talked about the Chancellor and the Government. He said
that Lord Holland was struck with Brougham&rsquo;s want of tact
at hearing him press Lord Grey to go to a public dinner at
Edinburgh <i>because</i> he was to be in the chair; that Lord Grey
did not think Brougham had been engaged <i>ab initio</i> in a
plot to get him out. Lord John talked of the House of
Lords, and how it and the House of Commons were to be
re-united. He thinks that the obstinacy of the House of
Lords and its Tory spirit are attributable solely to the numerous
creations of the last thirty or forty years.</p>

<p>Tommy Duncombe is the greatest political comedy going,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
he is engaged in a mediation between the master builders and
the operatives, who have quarrelled about the unions, and an
express came to him from Cubitt after dinner.</p>

<p>Sefton told me that Lord Grey, when he was at Windsor,
had a long conversation with the King, in which his Majesty
expressed no little dissatisfaction at what had recently occurred
and at the present posture of his affairs. He told me
that Lord Grey certainly would not have continued in office
under any circumstances till Parliament met again, and that,
in fact, his continual propositions to retire and expressions
of consciousness of inability and unfitness had been very
embarrassing and annoying both to his colleagues and the
King, and that the latter had evidently been tired out by
them, as was proved by his not making the slightest effort
to induce Lord Grey to remain when he tendered his resignation.
Grey acted very handsomely in giving his proxy to
Melbourne, and the reason he stayed away from the House
of Lords during the latter days of the session was that he
was afraid of being compelled to say something indicative of
the real state of his mind and feelings with regard to past
occurrences.</p>

<p>When I got to town yesterday, to my great astonishment
I found that the Vice-Chancellor had been at the office with
a peremptory mandate from the Chancellor to bring on the
Westmeath case on Friday next, sent up from Brougham
Hall. In my absence the summonses had been issued, but I
desired them all to be recalled, and the Vice-Chancellor soon
after happening to call on me, I told him what had occurred
before, and that the Lord President was opposed to the
cause being thus hurried on. He acquiesced, and wrote to
the Chancellor to say he had heard from me that it could
not be; and so it ended, but I dare say the Chancellor will
be in a violent rage, which I rather enjoy than
not.<a name="FNA_24_03" id="FNA_24_03"></a><a href="#FN_24_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
It is
very clear that he intends to exercise paramount authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD WESTMEATH&rsquo;S CASE.</span>
over the Judicial Committee, and to consider everything
connected with it at his disposal. When first he had the
Privy Council Bill drawn up by one of his devils, he intended
to create a new tribunal, of which he should be the
head, and though he was obliged to give up his original
design, he still considers himself entitled to deal with the
Judicial Committee as he pleases. If the Lord President had
more of the spirit that is due to the office over which he presides,
he would not suffer him to interfere, and I am resolved
if I can to get Lord Lansdowne to assert his own authority.
The Chancellor has promised Sefton that when Mr. Blackburn,
now a judge at the Mauritius, comes home, he shall
be made a Privy Councillor; that Sir Alexander Johnston,
who now attends the sittings of the Council, shall be dismissed,
and Blackburn invited to attend instead of him,
and that he shall have 400&#8467;. a year (which by the Act he
may). This, if it takes place, will be one of the grossest and
most barefaced jobs that ever were perpetrated; but I think
it can never be. What makes it worse is that Brougham
introduced this clause for the express purpose of meeting
Blackburn&rsquo;s case; so he told Sefton, but I suppose it means
that he made the stipend receivable by an ex-judge in <i>any
colony</i>, when the pretext for it was the power of obtaining
the assistance of Indian
judges.<a name="FNA_24_04" id="FNA_24_04"></a><a href="#FN_24_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h3>September 4th, 1834</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday. The King came to
town to receive the address of the City on the Queen&rsquo;s
return&mdash;the most ridiculous address I ever heard. The
Queen was too ill to appear. Her visit to Germany knocked
her up, and well it might, considering the life she led&mdash;always
up at six and never in bed till twelve, continual
receptions and ceremonies. Errol told me she showed them
her old bedroom in the palace (as they call it) at Meiningen&mdash;a
hole that an English housemaid would think it a hardship
to sleep in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Stanley (not the ex-Secretary, but the <ins class="correction" title = "text includes 'in' "></ins>Under-Secretary)
told me last night an anecdote of Melbourne which I can
very easily believe. When the King sent for him he told
Young &lsquo;he thought it a damned bore, and that he was in
many minds what he should do&mdash;be Minister or no.&rsquo; Young
said, &lsquo;Why, damn it, such a position never was occupied by
any Greek or Roman, and, if it only lasts two months, it is
well worth while to have been Prime Minister of England.&rsquo;
&lsquo;By God that&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said Melbourne; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo; Young is
his private secretary&mdash;a vulgar, familiar, impudent fellow,
but of indefatigable industry and a man who suits Melbourne.
His taste is not delicate enough to be shocked at
the coarseness, while his indolence is accommodated by the
industry, of his secretary. Then
Young<a name="FNA_24_05" id="FNA_24_05"></a><a href="#FN_24_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
knows many people,
many places, and many things; nobody knows whence he
comes or what is his origin, but he was a purser in the navy,
and made himself useful to the Duke of Devonshire when he
went to Russia, who recommended him to Melbourne. He
was a writer and runner for the newspapers, and has always
been an active citizen, struggling and striving to get on in
the world, and probably with no inconsiderable dexterity.
I know nothing of his honesty, for or against it; he seems
good-humoured, but vulgar and familiar. Ben Stanley and I
were talking about public men, and agreed that by far the
ablest, and at the same time the most unscrupulous, of them
are Brougham and O&rsquo;Connell, and that the latter is probably
on the whole the most devoid of principle. Their characters
and adventures would be worthy of a Plutarch.</p>

<h3>September 5th, 1834</h3>

<p>At Holland House yesterday, where I
had not been these two years. Met Lord Holland at Court,
who made me go. The last time I was with my Lady she was
so mighty uncivil that I left off my visits, and then we met
again as if there had been no interruption, and as if we had
been living together constantly. Spring Rice and his son,
Melbourne, and Palmerston dined there; Allen was at Dulwich,
but came in the evening, and so did Bobus Smith. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">HOLLAND HOUSE.</span>
was a great deal of very good talk, anecdotes, literary criticism,
and what not, some of which would be worth remembering,
though hardly sufficiently striking to be put down,
unless as forming a portion of a whole course of conversations
of this description. A vast depression came over my spirits,
though I was amused, and I don&rsquo;t suppose I uttered a dozen
words. It is certainly true that the atmosphere of Holland
House is often oppressive, but that was not it; it was a
painful consciousness of my own deficiencies and of my incapacity
to take a fair share in conversation of this description.
I felt as if a language was spoken before me which I
understood, but not enough to talk in it myself. There was
nothing discussed of which I was altogether ignorant, and
when the merits of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Crabbe were
brought into comparison, and Lord Holland cut jokes upon
Allen for his enthusiastic admiration of the &lsquo;De Moribus
Germanorum,&rsquo; it was not that I had not read the poets or
the historian, but that I felt I had not read them with profit.
I have not that familiarity with either which enables me to
discuss their merits, and a painful sense came over me of the
difference between one who has superficially read and one
who has studied, one who has laid a solid foundation in early
youth, gathering knowledge as he advances in years, all the
stores of his mind being so orderly disposed that they are at
all times available, and one who (as I have done) has huddled
together a quantity of loose reading, as vanity, curiosity, and
not seldom shame impelled; reading thus without system,
more to cover the deficiencies of ignorance than to augment
the stores of knowledge, loads the mind with an undigested
mass of matter, which proves when wanted to be of small
practical utility&mdash;in short, one must pay for the follies of
one&rsquo;s youth. He who wastes his early years in horse-racing
and all sorts of idleness, figuring away among the dissolute
and the foolish, must be content to play an inferior part
among the learned and the wise. Some instances there are
of men who have united both characters, but it will be found
that these have had frequent laborious intervals, that though
they may have been vicious, they have never been indolent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that their minds have never slumbered and lost by disuse
the power of exertion. Reflections of this sort make me very
uncomfortable, and I am ready to cry with vexation when I
think on my misspent life. If I was insensible to a higher
order of merit, and indifferent to a nobler kind of praise, I
should be happier far; but to be tormented with the sentiment
of an honourable ambition and with aspirations after
better things, and at the same time so sunk in sloth and bad
habits as to be incapable of those exertions without which
their objects are unattainable, is of all conditions the worst.
I sometimes think that it would be better for me, as I am
not what I might have been (if my education had been less
neglected, and my mind had undergone a better system of
moral discipline), if I was still lower than I am in the scale,
and belonged entirely to a more degraded caste; and then
again, when I look forward to that period which is fast approaching&mdash;</p>

I am thankful that I have still something in store, that
though far below the wise and the learned, I am still something
raised above the ignorant mob, that though much of
my mental substance has been wasted, I have enough left to
appear respectably in the world, and that I have at least
preserved that taste for literary pursuits which I cling to as
the greatest of blessings and the best security against the
tedium and vacuity which are the indispensable concomitants

<p>As a slight but imperfect sketch of the talk of Holland
House I will put down this:&mdash;</p>

<p>They talked of Taylor&rsquo;s new poem, &lsquo;Philip van Artevelde.&rsquo;
Melbourne had read and admired it. The preface, he said,
was affected and foolish, the poem very superior to anything
in Milman. There was one fine idea in the &lsquo;Fall of Jerusalem&rsquo;&mdash;that
of Titus, who felt himself propelled by an irresistible
impulse like that of the Greek dramatists, whose fate
is the great agent always pervading their dramas. They held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONVERSATION AT HOLLAND HOUSE.</span>
Wordsworth cheap, except Spring Rice, who was enthusiastic
about him. Holland thought Crabbe the greatest genius of
modern poets. Melbourne said he degraded every subject.
None of them had known Coleridge; his lectures were very
tiresome, but he is a poet of great merit. Then they spoke of
Spencer Perceval and Irving preaching in the streets. Irving
had called on Melbourne, and eloquently remonstrated that
&lsquo;they only asked the same licence that was given to puppet-shows
and other sights not to be prevented; that the command
was express, &ldquo;Go into the highways,&rdquo; and that they must obey
God rather than man.&rsquo; Melbourne said this was all very true
and unanswerable. &lsquo;What <i>did</i> you answer?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;I
said, &ldquo;You must not preach there.&rdquo;&rsquo; Then of Cambridge and
Goulburn, who is a saint and gave lectures in his room, by
which he has caught several young men. Lord Holland spoke
of George III.&rsquo;s letters to Lord North; the King liked Lord
North, hated the Duke of Richmond. Amongst the few
people he liked were Lord Loughborough and Lord Thurlow.
Thurlow was always &lsquo;endeavouring to undermine the Minister
with whom he was acting, and intriguing underhand with
his enemies.&rsquo; Loughborough used to say, &lsquo;Do what you
think right, and never think of what you are to say to excuse
it beforehand&rsquo;&mdash;a good maxim. The Duke of Richmond in
1763 or 1764, after an audience of the King in his closet, told
him that &lsquo;he had said that to him which if he was a subject
he should not scruple to call an untruth.&rsquo; The King never
forgave it, and the Duke had had the imprudence to make
a young king his enemy for life. This Duke of Richmond,
when Lord-Lieutenant of Sussex, during the American war,
sailed in a yacht through the fleet, when the King was
there, with American colours at his mast-head. He never
forgave Fox for putting the Duke of Portland instead of
himself at the head of the Government in 1782. During
the riots in 1780 on account of Admiral Keppel, Tom
Grenville burst open the door of the Admiralty, and assisted
at the pillage and destruction of papers. Lord Grey a
little while ago attacked him about it, and he did not deny
it. Such things could not be done now. During the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Windsor election they hired a mob to go down and throw
Lord Mornington (Lord Wellesley) over Windsor Bridge,
and Fitzpatrick said it would be so fine to see St. Patrick&rsquo;s
blue riband floating down the stream. They first sent to
Piper to know if Lord Mornington could swim. The plan was
defeated by his having a still stronger mob. After dinner
they discussed women&rsquo;s works: few <i>chefs-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres</i>; Madame
de Sévigné the best; the only three of a high class are Madame
de Sévigné, Madame de Stael, and (Bobus Smith said)
Sappho, but of her not above forty lines are extant: these,
however, are unrivalled; Mrs Somerville is very great in
the exact sciences. Lady Holland would not hear of Madame
de Stael. They agreed as to Miss Austen that her novels
are excellent. Quintus Curtius is confirmed by Burnes&rsquo;
travels in Bokhara, but was reckoned no authority by the
greatest scholars; Lord Melbourne said Mitford had expressed
his confidence in him. Of the early English kings
there is no reason to believe that any king before Edward III.
understood the English language; the quarrel between
Beckett and King Henry II. was attributed (by some writers)
to the hostile feeling between Normans and Saxons, and this
was the principal motive of the quarrel and the murder of the
Archbishop. Klopstock had a <i>sect</i> of admirers in Germany;
some young students made a pilgrimage from Gottingen to
Hamburg, where Klopstock lived in his old age, to ask him
the meaning of a passage in one of his works which they
could not understand. He looked at it, and then said that
he could not then recollect what it was that he meant when
he wrote it, but that he knew it was the finest thing he
ever wrote, and they could not do better than devote their
lives to the discovery of its meaning.</p>

<h3>September 7th, 1834</h3>

<p>At Holland House again; only Bobus
Smith and Melbourne; these two, with Allen, and Lord
Holland agreeable enough. Melbourne&rsquo;s excellent scholarship
and universal information remarkably display themselves
in society, and he delivers himself with an energy
which shows how deeply his mind is impressed with literary
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD MELBOURNE&rsquo;S LITERARY CONVERSATION.</span>
After dinner there was much talk of the Church, and
Allen spoke of the early reformers, the Catharists, and
how the early Christians persecuted each other; Melbourne
quoted Vigilantius&rsquo;s letter to Jerome, and then asked Allen
about the 11th of Henry IV., an Act passed by the Commons
against the Church, and referred to the dialogue between
the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely at the
beginning of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Henry V.,&rsquo; which Lord Holland
sent for and read, Melbourne knowing it all by heart and
prompting all the time. Lingard says of this statute that
the Commons proposed to the King to commit an act of
spoliation on the clergy, but that the King sharply rebuked
them and desired to hear no more of the matter. About etymologies
Melbourne quoted Tooke&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diversions of Purley,&rsquo;
which he seemed to have at his fingers&rsquo; ends. I forget what
other topics were discussed, but after Lady Holland and
Melbourne and Allen went to bed, Lord Holland, Bobus,
and I sat down, and Lord Holland told us many anecdotes
about the great orators of his early days. Fox used to say
Grey was the most prudent man he knew, and this perhaps
owing to his having got into a scrape early in his Parliamentary
life, by attacking Pitt, who gave him a severe
castigation; it was about his letter to the Prince being sent
by a servant during the Regency discussions. Fox thought
his own speech in 1804 on going to war with France the
best he ever made. Lord Holland believed that Pitt (the
younger) was not so eloquent as Chatham. Grattan said,
&lsquo;He takes longer flights, does not soar so high.&rsquo; No power
was ever equal to Chatham&rsquo;s over a public assembly, much
greater in the Commons than it was afterwards in the Lords.
When Sir Thomas Robinson had been boring the House on
some commercial question, and introduced the word &lsquo;sugar&rsquo;
so often that there was at last a laugh as often as he did so,
Chatham, then Mr. Pitt, who had put him up, grew very
angry, and at last his wrath boiled over. When Robinson
sat down Pitt rose, and with a tone and manner of the
utmost indignation began, &lsquo;Mr. Speaker, sir&mdash;sugar&mdash;I say
sugar. Who laughs now?&rsquo; and nobody did laugh. Once in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the House of Lords, on a debate during the American war,
he said he hoped the King might be awakened from his
slumbers. There was a cry of &lsquo;Order! order!&rsquo; &lsquo;Order,
my Lords?&rsquo; burst out Chatham, &lsquo;Order? I have not been
disorderly, but I <i>will</i> be disorderly. I repeat again, I hope
that his Majesty may be awakened from his slumbers, but
that he may be awakened by such an awful apparition as that
which drew King Priam&rsquo;s curtains in the dead of the night
and told him of the conflagration of his empire.&rsquo; Holland
regretted much that he had never heard Lord North, whom
he fancied he should have liked as much as any of his great
opponents; his temper, shrewdness, humour, and power of
argument were very great. Tommy Townshend, a violent,
foolish fellow, who was always talking strong language, said
in some debate, &lsquo;Nothing will satisfy me but to have the noble
Lord&rsquo;s head; I will have his head.&rsquo; Lord North said, &lsquo;The
honourable gentleman says he will have my head. I bear him
no malice in return, for though the honourable gentleman
says he will have my head, I can assure him that I would on
no account have his.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>September 13th, 1834</h3>

<p>Dined again at Holland House the day
before yesterday; Melbourne, Rice, Lord and Lady Albemarle,
and Lord Gosford; rather dull. A discussion about <i>who</i> was
the man in a mask who cut Charles I.&rsquo;s head off; Mackintosh
believed he knew. What a literary puerility! The man in
a mask was Jack Ketch (whatever his name was); who can
doubt it? Where was the man, Roundhead or Puritan,
who as an amateur would have mounted the scaffold to perform
this office? But the executioner, though only discharging
the duties of his office, probably thought in those excited
times that he would not be safe from the vengeance of some
enthusiastic cavalier, and that it was more prudent to conceal
the features of the man by whom the deed was done.
Melbourne swore that Henry VIII. was the greatest man who
ever lived, and Allen declared if he had not married Ann
Boleyn we should have continued Catholics to this day, both
of which assertions I ventured to dispute. Allen with all his
learning is fond of a paradox, and his prejudices shine forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM&rsquo;S ABERRATIONS.</span>
in every question in which Church and religion are implicated.
Melbourne loves dashing opinions.</p>

<h3>September 18th, 1834</h3>

<p>For some weeks past a fierce war has
been waged by the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; against the Chancellor. It was
declared in some menacing articles which soon swelled into
a tone of rebuke, and have since been sharpened into attacks
of a constancy, violence, and vigour quite unexampled; all
the power of writing which the paper can command&mdash;argument,
abuse, and ridicule&mdash;have been heaped day after day
upon him, and when it took a little breathing time it filled
up the interval by quotations from other papers, which have
been abundantly supplied both by the London and the
country press. I do not yet know what are the secret
causes which have stirred the wrath of the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo; The
&lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; has once a week thrown into the general contribution
of rancour an article perhaps wittier and more pungent
than any which have appeared in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; but between
them they have flagellated him till he is raw, and it is very
clear that he feels it quite as acutely as they can desire.
While they have thus been administering castigation in this
unsparing style, he has afforded them the best opportunities
by his extraordinary progress in Scotland, and the astonishing
speeches which he made at Aberdeen and Dundee, making
more mountebank exhibitions than he did in the House of
Lords, and exciting the unquenchable laughter of his enemies
and the continual terror of his friends. Lord Holland
told me that he was trembling for the account of the
Edinburgh dinner. That great affair appears, however (by
the first half of the proceedings), to have gone off very well.
Lord Grey in his speech confined himself to general topics,
and he and Brougham steered extremely clear of one another,
but Brougham made some allusions which Durham took to
himself, and replied to with considerable asperity of tone,
avoiding, however, any personalities and anything like a
direct collision. Everybody asks, How long will Brougham
be permitted to go on playing these ape&rsquo;s tricks and scattering
his flummery and his lies? and then they say, But you
can&rsquo;t get rid of him, and the Government (dangerous as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is to them) could not get on without him. There would
probably be no difficulty; experience has demonstrated to
me the extreme fallacy of the notion that <i>anybody</i> under <i>any</i>
circumstances is indispensable. Althorp appeared the most
indispensable man the other day, but that was only because his
friends and the fools in the House of Commons kept bawling
out that he was so till they persuaded him, themselves, and
everybody else that it really was the case. Who would
have dared to say that this Government could have gone on
without either Stanley in one House or Lord Grey in the
other? But anybody would have been scouted as mad who
had argued that it would go on just as well when deprived
of both of them. The Chancellor&rsquo;s amazing talents&mdash;his eloquence,
sarcasm, and varied powers&mdash;can never fail to produce
considerable effect; but in the House of Lords the field
is narrow for the display of these qualities, the audience is
cold and unfriendly, and he has excited such a general feeling
of personal animosity against himself, and has done such
irreparable injury to his character&mdash;having convinced all the
world that he is desperately ambitious, false, capricious,
intriguing, and governed by no principle, and under the
influence of no sentiment of honour&mdash;that his influence is
exceedingly diminished. Those who are charitably disposed
express their humane conviction that he is mad, and it
probably is not very remote from the
truth.<a name="FNA_24_06" id="FNA_24_06"></a><a href="#FN_24_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

[It is with pain and reluctance that I print these remarks on Lord
Brougham, and several passages in the preceding pages of these Memoirs
which are equally severe, and in some respects, I think, exaggerated. But
I certainly do not feel myself justified in withholding them. They were all
revised and corrected by the author himself with great care; and nothing
but a true and full account of the sentiments which Lord Brougham&rsquo;s conduct
had excited amongst his colleagues and contemporaries at that time
can account for the catastrophe which awaited him, and which excluded
him for the rest of his life from official life and employment.]</p></div>

<p>Henry Taylor brought me a parcel of letters to frank to
Southey the other day; they are from Newton, Cowper&rsquo;s
nephew (I think to W. Thornton), and they are to supply
Southey with materials for Cowper&rsquo;s Life, which he is writing.
There is one curious fact revealed in these letters, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CANNING AND LORD HOLLAND.</span>
accounts for much of Cowper&rsquo;s morbid state of mind and
fits of depression, as well as for the circumstance of his
running away from his place in the House of Lords. It
relates to some defect in his physical conformation; some
body found out his secret, and probably threatened its exposure.</p>

<h3>September 19th, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday at Holland House; nobody
there but Melbourne. We were talking of Reform, and Lord
Holland said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we were right about Reform,
but this I know, that if we were to propose it at all, we were
right in going the lengths we did, and this was Canning&rsquo;s
opinion.&rsquo; Melbourne said, &lsquo;Yes, I know it was, and that
was mine, and that was the reason why I was against Reform.&rsquo;
Holland then resumed that he had formerly been one of
Canning&rsquo;s most intimate friends at college; that at that time&mdash;the
beginning of the French Revolution&mdash;when a general excitement
prevailed, Canning was a great Jacobin, much more
so than he was himself; that Canning had always hated the
aristocracy (a hatred which they certainly returned with
interest); that in after life he had been separated from
Canning, and they had seen but little of each other. Just
before he was going to India, however, Holland called on
him, and Canning dined at Holland House. On one of these
occasions they had a conversation upon the subject of Reform,
when Canning said that he saw it was inevitable, and he was
not sorry to be away while the measure was accomplished,
but that if he had been here while it was mooted, he could
have <i>let those gentlemen</i> (the Whig aristocracy) <i>know that they
should gain nothing by it</i>. After dinner we had much talk
about religion, when Allen got into a fury; he thundered out
his invectives against the <i>charlatanerie</i> of the Apostles and
Fathers and the brutal ignorance of the early Christian
converts, when Holland said, laughing, &lsquo;Well, but you need
not abuse them so violently.&rsquo; They were in high delight at
Holland House at the way the Edinburgh dinner went off.
It was a very ludicrous incident that the Scotchmen could
not be kept from falling to before Lord Grey and the grandees
arrived, and when they did come most of the dinner was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
already eaten up. The Chancellor is said to have made an
admirable speech at the meeting of <i>savans</i>, full of dignity,
propriety, and eloquence, and the <i>savans</i> spoke one more
absurdly than another.</p>

<h3>September 23rd, 1834</h3>

<p>On Saturday at Stoke; came up yesterday
with Melbourne. We had a great deal of talk. As soon as
we got into the carriage he asked me if I thought it was
true that Talleyrand had taken such offence at Palmerston
that he would not return here on that account, and if I knew
what it was that had affronted him, whether any deficiency
in diplomatic punctilio or general offensiveness of manner.
I told him I had no doubt it was true, and that the complaints
against Palmerston were so general that there must be some
cause for them, and though Madame de Lieven might be
prejudiced against him, <i>all</i> the foreign Ambassadors could
not be so. He said it was very extraordinary if it was so,
tried to argue that it might not be the case, and put it in
all sorts of different ways; he said that Palmerston exhibited
no signs of temper or arrogance with his colleagues, but quite
the reverse; he owned, however, he was very obstinate. We
then talked over the Stratford Canning business; he admitted
that it was unfortunate and might lead to serious consequences,
both as to our relations with the Emperor and to
the question of diplomatic expenses here. I expressed my
astonishment that Palmerston&rsquo;s obstinacy should have been
permitted to have its own way in the matter, and I should
guess, from his own strong opinion on the subject, that an
Ambassador would be sent before long. He told me&mdash;what
I did not know before&mdash;that the King of Prussia had desired
to have Lord Clanwilliam recalled from Berlin.</p>

<p>He then talked of Brougham, and I found that he knows
him thoroughly, and is more on his guard than I thought
he was with regard to him. I told him of the change in
Sefton&rsquo;s feelings towards him on Lord Grey&rsquo;s account, and
also of Brougham&rsquo;s strange want of discrimination and his
imprudence in congratulating himself to Sefton on the recent
changes, and of his expectations of profiting by Melbourne&rsquo;s
advancement to power. I touched lightly on the latter part,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PALMERSTON AND BROUGHAM.</span>
because it is never prudent to dwell upon topics which are injurious
to a person&rsquo;s vanity, and a word dropped upon so tender
a part produces as much effect as the strongest argument.
He seemed not a little struck by it, and when I said that
I thought there was a taint of insanity in the Chancellor, he
said that he thought a great change in him was manifest in
the course of the last year, and admitted that he did not think
him of sound mind certainly. This he rather implied than
expressed, however. He talked of his conduct in Parliament,
and observed upon the strange forbearance of the Tories towards
him; he thought he had never given stronger evidence
of talent than in some of his speeches during the last session.
I asked him if the King and Brougham were well together.
He shook his head: &lsquo;not at all, and the King can&rsquo;t bear these
exhibitions in Scotland.&rsquo; He said the King liked Palmerston,
Auckland, Spring Rice, and Mulgrave; had no fancy for any
of the rest. (I suspect he likes him (Melbourne), because he
appears to talk openly to him, and to express his feelings
about the others, and I dare say Melbourne puts him at his
ease.) He can&rsquo;t bear John Russell, respects Althorp (and particularly
Lord Spencer), but hates Althorp&rsquo;s politics; treats
Lord Holland with the familiarity of a
connexion,<a name="FNA_24_07" id="FNA_24_07"></a><a href="#FN_24_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
but doesn&rsquo;t
like his politics either; he is tenacious about having everything
laid before him, often gives his opinion, but is easily
satisfied; liked Lord Grey, but was never quite at his ease
with him (this accounts for his taking Lord Grey&rsquo;s resignation
as quietly as he did); has a very John-Bullish aversion
to the French, and the junction of the English and French
fleets two years ago was a bitter pill for him to swallow.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_24_07" id="FN_24_07"></a><a href="#FNA_24_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[Colonel Fox, Lord Holland&rsquo;s eldest son, having married Lady Mary,
the King&rsquo;s eldest daughter, both however born out of wedlock.]</p></div>

<p>We afterwards talked of Canning and the Duke of Wellington,
and the breaking up of the Tory Government. I
told him that I believed the Duke and the Tories were aware
of Canning&rsquo;s communications with Brougham. Brougham
wrote to Canning and made him an unqualified offer of
support. When the King asked Canning how he was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
obtain support enough to carry on the Government, he pulled
this letter out of his pocket, gave it to him, and said, &lsquo;Sir, your
father broke the domination of the Whigs; I hope your
Majesty will not endure that of the Tories.&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the
King; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned if I do;&rsquo; and he made him Minister.
This Canning told Melbourne himself.</p>

<h3>September 25th, 1834</h3>

<p>Dined yesterday at Holland House;
only Melbourne and Pahlen, and in the evening Senior came.
He is a very able man&mdash;a conveyancer, great political economist,
and author of various works on that subject. He
was employed by Government to draw up the Poor Law Bill,
and might have been one of the Poor Law Commissioners if
he would have accepted the office; his profits in his profession
are too great to be given up for this occupation. By a
discussion which arose about Bickersteth&rsquo;s merits it was clear
that there is a question of his being Solicitor-General. Melbourne
said &lsquo;he was a Benthamite, and they were all fools.&rsquo;
(He said a doctrinaire was a fool, but an honest man.) I
said &lsquo;the Austins were not fools.&rsquo; &lsquo;Austin? Oh, a damned
fool. Did you ever read his book on &ldquo;Jurisprudence&rdquo;?&rsquo; I said
I had read a great part of it, and that it did not appear to
be the work of a fool. He said he had read it all, and that
it was the dullest book he ever read, and full of truisms
elaborately set forth. Melbourne is very fond of being
slashing and paradoxical. It is astonishing how much he
reads even now that he is Prime Minister. He is greatly
addicted to theology, and loves conversing on the subject of
religion. &mdash;&mdash;, who wanted him to marry her (which he
won&rsquo;t do, though he likes to talk to her), is the depositary
of his thoughts and notions on these subjects, and the other
day she told me he sent her a book (I forget what) on the
Revelation stuffed with marginal notes of his own. It was
not long ago that he <i>studied</i> Lardner&rsquo;s book on the &lsquo;Credibility
of the Christian Religion,&rsquo; and compared it with the
Bible as he went along. She fancies that all this reading
and reflection have turned him into the right way. I can
see no symptom of it at Holland House.</p>

<p>After dinner we talked of languages, and Lord Holland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REFLECTIONS ON THE TURF.</span>
insisted that Spanish was the finest of all and the best
adapted to eloquence. They said that George Villiers wrote
word that nothing could be better than the speaking in the
Cortes&mdash;great readiness and acuteness in reply&mdash;and that a
more dexterous and skilful debater than Martinez de la Rosa
could not be found in any assembly. &lsquo;<i>That</i> speaking so well
is the worst thing about them,&rsquo; said Melbourne. &lsquo;Ah, that
is one of your paradoxes,&rsquo; Lord Holland replied.</p>

<p>Allen talked to me about the Harley papers, which were
left in a box not to be opened for sixty years; the box was
only opened a few years ago at my cousin Titchfield&rsquo;s (the
first) desire, and the papers submitted to Mackintosh, with
permission to publish them in his &lsquo;History of England.&rsquo;
Mackintosh&rsquo;s death put an end to this, and Allen wants me to
ask my uncle the Duke of Portland to put them in my hands
and let me publish them. I never did so. Macaulay had
all Mackintosh&rsquo;s papers, and amongst them his notes from
these MSS.</p>

<h3>London, November 13th, 1834</h3>

<p>For two months nearly that I
have been in this country I have not written a line, having
had nothing worth recording to put down. It is not worth
my while to write, nor anybody else&rsquo;s to read (should anybody
ever read these memoranda), the details of racing and all
that thereunto appertains, and though several disagreeable
occurrences have ruffled the stream of my life, I have no
pleasure in recording these; for if their consequences pass
away, and I can forget them, it is better not at any future
time to awaken &lsquo;the scorpion sting of griefs subdued.&rsquo; Of
public events I have known nothing but what everybody else
knows, and it would have been mere waste of time to copy
from the newspapers accounts of the conflagration of the
Houses of Parliament or the Durham dinner at Glasgow.
My campaign on the turf has been a successful one. Still
all this success has not prevented frequent disgusts, and I
derive anything but unmixed pleasure from this pursuit even
when I win by it. Besides the continual disappointments
and difficulties incident to it, which harass the mind, the life
it compels me to lead, the intimacies arising out of it, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
associates and the war against villany and trickery, being
haunted by continual suspicions, discovering the trust-<i>un</i>worthiness
of one&rsquo;s most intimate friends, the necessity of
insincerity and concealment sometimes where one feels that
one ought and would desire to be most open; then the degrading
nature of the occupation, mixing with the lowest of
mankind, and absorbed in the business for the sole purpose
of getting money, the consciousness of a sort of degradation
of intellect, the conviction of the deteriorating effects upon
both the feelings and the understanding which are produced,
the sort of dram-drinking excitement of it&mdash;all these things
and these thoughts torment me, and often turn my pleasure
to pain. On arriving in town I went to Crockford&rsquo;s, where
I found all the usual set of people, and soon after Sefton
came in. Lord Spencer&rsquo;s death had taken place the day
before; he knew nothing of the probable arrangements, but he
told me that he supposed Althorp would go to the Admiralty
and Auckland to India. But what he was fullest of was that
Mrs. Lane Fox&rsquo;s house was become the great rendezvous of a
considerable part of the Cabinet. The Chancellor, Melbourne,
Duncannon, and Mulgrave are there every day and all day;
they all dine with her, or meet her (the only woman) at each
other&rsquo;s houses, as often as they can. It certainly is a droll
connexion. The squabbles between Brougham and Durham
seem to have resolved themselves into a mere personal coldness,
and there is no question now of any hostilities between
them. I never thought there would be, though some people
apparently did; but they both would much rather rail than
fight.</p>

<h3>November 14th, 1834</h3>

<p>Went down to the Council Office yesterday,
and found them in the middle of Lord Westmeath&rsquo;s case&mdash;Lord
Lansdowne, the Vice-Chancellor, Parke, Erskine,
and Vaughan. Lushington was for Lady Westmeath, and
Follett (with a civilian) for him. After the argument there
was a discussion, and well did Westmeath do, for they reduced
the alimony from 700&#8467;. to 315&#8467;. a year, and the arrears
in the same proportion. Thus Westmeath succeeded in
great measure in his appeal, which he would not have done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RECENT LAW APPOINTMENTS.</span>
if the Chancellor had contrived to lug on the case as he
wished; for Erskine was all for giving her more, the others
did not seem averse, and but for Parke, who hit off the right
principle, as well as what best accorded with the justice of
the case, she would certainly have got a much larger award.</p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor afterwards told me the history of
the recent legal appointments. There never was any difference
of opinion between Brougham and Melbourne on the
subject of either. Campbell accepted the Attorney-Generalship
on the express condition that he should not expect to
succeed as a matter of right to any vacancy in the Courts,
but on Leach&rsquo;s death he did instantly urge his claims.
Brougham wrote to Melbourne, and speedily followed his
letter to London, and they both agreed not to listen to this
claim, and to promote Pepys. I don&rsquo;t know how they disposed
of Horne&rsquo;s claim.
Bickersteth<a name="FNA_24_08" id="FNA_24_08"></a><a href="#FN_24_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
refused to be Solicitor-General
on account of his health, and not choosing to face
the House of Commons and its work. Shadwell told me
that he wrote to Brougham and suggested Rolfe when the
vacancy occurred, that he had not been in great practice, but
was a good lawyer and excellent speaker, and that the
Chancellor and Melbourne had likewise concurred in this
appointment. Nothing is settled about the new arrangements
rendered necessary by Lord Spencer&rsquo;s death, but
Melbourne went to Brighton yesterday. Rice has worked
hard to master the Colonial business, and probably will not
like to be translated to the Exchequer; besides, it is supposed
that his seat at Cambridge would be in great peril. People
talk of their not going on; how can any others go on better?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_24_08" id="FN_24_08"></a><a href="#FNA_24_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
[Mr. Bickersteth refused to be Solicitor-General because the offer was
made to him by the Lord Chancellor, and not by the Prime Minister. At
that time he was personally unacquainted with Lord Melbourne, but he
consented to call on him at Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s request, and the offer was
repeated, but not accepted. The real reason of his refusal was his profound
distrust of Lord Brougham, which amounted to aversion, and he thought it
unworthy of himself to accept the office of a law officer of the Crown under
a Chancellor with whom he could not conscientiously act. I have read a
MS. narrative of the whole transaction by Lord Langdale himself, in which
these sentiments are very strongly expressed.]</p></div>

<p>Lord Lansdowne has just returned from Paris, where, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
told me, he had frequent conversations with the King. The
new Ministry is a wretched patched-up affair; but the
Government of France is centred in the King, and it is his
great power and influence in the Chambers, and not the
ability of his Ministers (be they who they may), that keeps
the thing going. This influence appears to be immense, and
without enjoying any popularity, there is an universal opinion
that Louis Philippe is indispensable to France. He told
Lord Lansdowne that he had always been against the appointment
of Marshal Gérard as President of the Council,
although he had a high opinion of him, but that he was
aware he had not tact and judgment sufficient for that post,
and he had told his Ministers that he would consent to the
appointment if they insisted on it, but that he warned them
that it would break up the Government. Whatever may be
the instability of this or any other Administration, it is said
that nothing can be more firm and secure than the King&rsquo;s
tenure of his crown. He appears, in fact, to be the very man
that France requires, and as he is in the vigour of life and
has a reasonable prospect of a long reign, he will probably
consolidate the interest of his family and extinguish whatever
lingering chance there might be of the restoration of
the old effete dynasty.</p>

<h3>November 16th, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning the town was electrified
by the news that Melbourne&rsquo;s Government was at an
end. Nobody had the slightest suspicion of such an impending
catastrophe; the Ministers themselves reposed in perfect security.
I never saw astonishment so great on every side; nobody
pretended to have prophesied or expected such an event.
Thus it befell:&mdash;On Thursday Melbourne went to Brighton to
make the arrangements necessary on Lord Spencer&rsquo;s death.
He had previously received a letter from the King, which
contained nothing indicative of the fate that awaited him.
He had his audience on Thursday afternoon, and offered his
Majesty the choice of Spring Rice, Lord John Russell, or Abercromby
to lead the House of Commons and fill the vacant
office. The King made some objections, and said he must take
time to consider it. Nothing more passed that night, and the
next day, when Melbourne saw the King, his Majesty placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in his hands a letter containing his determination. It was
couched in terms personally complimentary to Melbourne,
but he said that, having lost the services of Lord Althorp as
leader of the House of Commons, he could feel no confidence
in the stability of his Government when led by any other
member of it; that they were already in a minority in the
House of Peers, and he had every reason to believe the
removal of Lord Althorp would speedily put them in the same
situation in the other House; that under such circumstances
he felt other arrangements to be necessary, and that it was
his intention to send for the Duke of Wellington. Nothing
could be more peremptory and decisive, and not a loophole
was left for explanation or arrangements, or endeavour to
patch the thing up. The King wrote to the Duke, and,
what is rather droll, the letter was despatched by Melbourne&rsquo;s
carriage, which returned to town. It is very evident that
the King has long determined to seize the first plausible
pretext he could find for getting rid of these people, whom
he dislikes and fears, and that he thinks (justly or not remains
to be proved) the translation of Althorp affords him a
good opportunity, and such a one perhaps as may not speedily
occur again. It is long since a Government has been so summarily
dismissed&mdash;regularly kicked out, in the simplest sense
of that phrase. Melbourne&rsquo;s colleagues expected his return
without a shadow of apprehension, or doubt. He got back
late, and wrote to none of them. The Chancellor, who had
dined at Holland House, called on him and heard the news;
the others (except Duncannon, who went to him, and I
believe Palmerston) remained in happy ignorance till yesterday
morning, when they were saluted at their rising
with the astounding intelligence. All the Ministers (except
Brougham) read the account of their dismissal in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;
the next morning, and this was the first they heard of it.
Melbourne resolved to say nothing that night, but summoned
an early Cabinet, when he meant to impart it. Brougham
called on him on his way from Holland House. Melbourne
told him, but made him promise not to say a word of it to
anybody. He promised, and the moment he quitted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A STRANGE INTRIGUE.</span>
house sent to the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; office and told them what had
occurred, with the well-known addition that &lsquo;the Queen had
done it all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They attribute their fall to the influence of the Queen,
and fancy that it is the result of a preconcerted scheme and
intrigue with the Tories, neither of which do I believe to be
true. With regard to the latter notion, the absence of Sir
Robert Peel, who is travelling in Italy, is a conclusive proof
of its falseness. He never would have been absent if he had
foreseen the remotest possibility of a crisis, and the death of
Lord Spencer has been imminent and expected for some
time past. I am convinced that it is the execution of a
project which the King has long nourished of delivering
himself from the Whigs whenever he could. His original
dislike has been exasperated to a great pitch by the mountebank
exhibitions of Brougham, and he is so alarmed and
disgusted at the Radical propensities which the Durham
dinner has manifested, that he is resolved to try whether
the Government cannot be conducted upon principles which
are called Conservative, but which shall really be <i>bonâ fide</i>
opposed to the ultra doctrines and wild schemes which he
knows are not distasteful to at least one-half of his late
Cabinet.</p>

<p>His resentment against these people has been considerably
increased by the discovery (which he believes he has
made) of his having been grossly deceived at the period of
Lord Grey&rsquo;s retirement and the formation of Melbourne&rsquo;s
Administration. The circumstances of this part of the
business I know only imperfectly, so much so as to leave a
good deal that requires explanation in order to make it
intelligible; but I was told on good authority yesterday
that at that time Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington
were quite prepared to undertake the formation of a
Government if it had been proposed to them, and that he
had every reason to believe they had been betrayed by &lsquo;that
scoundrel H&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; who had been employed by some of the
other party to find out what their intentions and dispositions
were upon that point; that H&mdash;&mdash; had gone to them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
asked them the question, and having at that time entire
confidence in him, they had told him if it was offered to
them they certainly would undertake it; that he had never
told them or given them any reason to believe that he was
commissioned to find out their resolution, and they think he
returned to his employer and told him that they must take
care how such an offer was made to the Tories, as they
would certainly accept it if it was offered. Melbourne was
no party to this transaction, but the consequence of it was
that the King was given to understand that it would be
useless to propose to them to form a Government, for they
were not prepared to do so, and he was advised to make the
proposal of a coalition, which was made, and which they of
course rejected. The King, it appears, subsequently discovered
what their disposition had been at the time, and that
he had been misled and deceived, and this made him very
indignant.</p>

<p>I should like to know this story more in detail, for it
would be curious to learn who were the agents in the intrigue,
and, above all, what could induce H&mdash;&mdash; to sacrifice
the interests of the Duke of Wellington (with whom he had
great influence and to whom he had great obligations) and
of the party from which alone he could expect any solid
advantages to those of the Whigs, from whom he could
derive no benefit sufficient to compensate him for the danger
as well as treachery of the transaction. I never liked this
fellow, and always thought him a low blackguard, and, however
shrewd and active, a bad confidant and &lsquo;fidus Achates&rsquo;
for the Duke to have taken up; but the folly and shortsightedness
of this proceeding seem so obvious (to say nothing
of its villany) that I cannot without strong proofs
yield my belief to the story, though Peel is not a man to
harbour such strong suspicions on slight grounds.</p>

<p>This morning Lord Lansdowne wrote me word that the
Duke had accepted, but it is probable that nothing can be
done till Peel returns from Italy. He will accept no post
but that of Prime Minister, though the King would prefer to
put the Duke there if he would take it.</p>

<h3>November 17th, 1834</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">EFFECT OF THE COUP AT HOLLAND HOUSE.</span>
It is only bit by bit that one ascertains
the truth in affairs like these. It is true that the King
imparted his resolution to Melbourne in a letter, but not
true in the sense in which that fact is intended to be taken.
I went to Holland House yesterday, but my Lord and my
Lady were gone to town. I met the heavy chariot slowly
moving back through Kensington, and stopped to talk to
them. They seemed in tolerably good spirits, all things
considered; like the rest, they had not a suspicion of what
was going to happen. Melbourne was to have dined there
on Friday, but did not arrive. At eleven o&rsquo;clock everybody
went away, without any tidings having come of Melbourne;
the next morning Lord Holland read in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; that the
Government was at an end. Allen swore that it must be a
hoax, and it was only upon receiving a summons to the
Cabinet at twelve instead of two that Holland began to think
there was <i>something in it</i>. He told me that the King had
two long conversations with Melbourne, in which he explained
his opinions, motives, and intentions, and finally gave him
the letter, that he might show it to his colleagues. It would
now appear that no definite arrangements were proposed
to him at all; nothing, in fact, could be settled till it was
ascertained what Althorp would do&mdash;whether he would continue
in office, and what office he would take&mdash;but they
intended that Lord John Russell should be the leader in the
House of Commons, or what they call &lsquo;try it.&rsquo; This must
have been peculiarly distasteful to the King, who dislikes
Lord John, and thinks him a dangerous little Radical, and
Melbourne is well aware of this antipathy. On <i>the</i> Friday
night Melbourne, with a party of his colleagues&mdash;Mulgrave,
Ben Stanley, Poulett Thompson, and one or two more&mdash;were
at the play just opposite to me; the piece was the &lsquo;Regent,&rsquo;
and it was full of jokes about dismissing Ministers and other
things very applicable, at which Melbourne at least (who
does not care a button about <i>office</i>, whatever he may do
about power) was heartily amused. To-day the King came
to town to receive the resignations, for he is resolved to
finish off the whole affair at once and make <i>maison nette</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
they have been ordered therefore to attend at St. James&rsquo;s
and give up their seals.</p>

<p><i>Five o&rsquo;clock</i>.&mdash;Just returned from St. James&rsquo;s. In the
outer room I found assembled the Duke of Wellington,
Lyndhurst, Rosslyn, Goulburn, Hardinge, the Speaker, Jersey,
Maryborough, Cowley, whom the Duke had collected in
order to form a Privy Council; in the Throne Room the ex-Cabinet
congregated, and it was amusing to watch them as
they passed through the camp of their enemies, and to see
their different greetings and bows; all interchanged some
slight civility except Brougham, who stalked through looking
as black as thunder and took no notice of anybody.
The first question that arose was, What was to be done
about the prorogation? The Duke thought they might as
well finish that business to-day, and I went on an embassy
into the other room to propose it; but they declined to have
anything to say to it and evinced great anxiety to take no
part in any proceedings of this day. Accordingly Lord
Lansdowne explained to the King that the presence of a
Lord President was not necessary, and that there was a
sufficiency of Tory Lords to form a Council, so his Majesty
consented to the late Ministers going away. As I thought
the company of those who were coming in would be more
cheerful and agreeable than that of those who were going
out, I passed my time in the outer room, and had a good
deal of conversation with the Duke and Lyndhurst, from
whom I gathered everything that I did not know before.
After the Whigs had made their exit we went into the
Throne Room, and the King sent for Lyndhurst, who only
stayed with him a few minutes, and then the Duke and all
the Privy Councillors were summoned. After greeting them
all, and desiring them to sit down, he began a speech
nearly as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Having thought proper to make a change
in my Government, at the present moment I have directed
a new commission to be issued for executing the office of
Lord High Treasurer, at the head of which I have placed
the Duke of Wellington, and his Grace has kissed hands
accordingly upon that appointment. As by the Constitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE TORIES IN OFFICE.</span>
of this country the King can do no wrong, but those persons
are responsible for his acts in whom he places his confidence&mdash;as
I do in the Lords now present&mdash;it is necessary to place
the seals of the Secretary of State for the Home Department
in those hands in which I can best confide, and I have
therefore thought proper to confer that office likewise on
his Grace, who will be sworn in accordingly.&rsquo; Here the
Duke came round, and, after much fumbling for his spectacles,
took the oath of Secretary of State. The King then
resumed, &lsquo;It is likewise necessary for me to dispose of the
seals of the other two Secretaries of State, and I therefore
place them likewise for the present in the same hands, as he
is already First Lord of the Treasury and Secretary of State
for the Home Office.&rsquo; Then, turning to me, he asked if
there was any business, and being told there was none,
desired me to retire. When I was gone he began another
harangue, to the effect that he had endeavoured, since he
had been upon the throne, to do for the best, and that he
could not fill up any of the other offices at present.</p>

<p>Now for what I learned from the Duke and Lyndhurst.
The former told me that he was just going out hunting when
the messenger arrived; that the letter merely said that the
King wished to see him, to consult with him as to the steps he
should take with regard to the formation of another Government.
He went off directly, and at once told the King that
the best thing he could do was to send for Sir Robert Peel,
and that until he arrived he would undertake to carry on
the Government by a provisional arrangement, and would
do nothing more until Peel&rsquo;s return. So the matter accordingly
stands, and no other appointment will be made except
that the Great Seal will be transferred to Lyndhurst, without,
however (at present), his becoming Chancellor. He talked a
great deal about the state of the late Government, and what
passed between Melbourne and the King, but I heard this
still more in detail from Lyndhurst afterwards.</p>

<p>I asked the Duke if he had seen the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; this morning.
He said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and I told him there appeared in it a considerable
disposition to support the new Government, and I thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it would be very advisable to obtain that support if it could
be done. He said he was aware that he had formerly too
much neglected the press, but he did not think the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;
could be influenced. I urged him to avail himself of any
opportunity to try, and he seemed very well disposed to do
so. Lyndhurst, whom I afterwards talked to for a long time,
went into the whole business. He said that it was very
desirable that the public should know the truth of what had
taken place between the King and Melbourne, both in conversation
and by letter, because it would be seen that the
former was in no way to blame. [This case, such as Lyndhurst
described it to me, was afterwards put hypothetically in
the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; to which it was furnished probably by Scarlett,
but the Whigs emphatically declare that it is not correct, and
that it will be found, when Melbourne states the truth (as he
will require the King&rsquo;s permission to do), that his Majesty had
no case at all. In the midst of these conflicting assertions
time must show.&mdash;<i>November 26th</i>.] Melbourne told him
that, as he had only undertaken to carry on the Government
in consideration of having the assistance of Althorp
in the House of Commons, his removal made it necessary
to adopt a new organisation altogether, that some considerable
concessions to the principle of Reform were judged to
be necessary, and the appointment of a successor to Althorp,
who should carry them into effect; that he was of opinion
that without these the Government could not go on, and at
the same time it was necessary to state that there were
members of the Cabinet who did not coincide with these
views, and who would retire when Parliament met if they
were adopted. These were Lord Lansdowne and Spring Rice;
Lord John Russell was to lead in the House of Commons, but
the loss of Rice would be a severe blow to them. The concessions
related principally to Church reform. The disunion
of the Cabinet being thus exhibited, it was clear the Government
could not go on without some material alteration in its
composition. The King urged this and asked Melbourne
from what quarter the necessary accession of strength was
to be procured, and whether he could hope for it from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POLICY OF LORD LYNDHURST.</span>
Conservative interest. He owned that nothing was to be
expected from that quarter. It remained, then, that it was
only from the more extreme party that their ranks could be
recruited. To this the King would not consent, and he therefore
imparted to him his resolution of placing the Government
in other
hands.<a name="FNA_25_01" id="FNA_25_01"></a><a href="#FN_25_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_25_01" id="FN_25_01"></a><a href="#FNA_25_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[This account of the transaction is confirmed in almost every particular
by the statement drawn up by King William himself (or by his directions)
for the information of Sir Robert Peel, and first published in Baron Stockmar&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo; in 1872.]</p></div>

<p>Lyndhurst then went off upon the difficulties of their
position. I told him that the Duke had said to me, &lsquo;If the
King had been a very clever man, he would probably have
played a more adroit game, by letting them go on till Parliament
met, and then taking the opportunity which would
soon present itself of breaking them up;&rsquo; that I disagreed
with the Duke, and thought it infinitely more convenient
that this change should take place while Parliament was not
sitting, to which Lyndhurst fully agreed. He said that they
must dissolve as soon as Peel came home, that they had no
alternative; that it would not do to <i>try</i> this Parliament, to
run the chance of a failure and dissolve after having experienced
it, that this would be too great a risk. He said that
they had several seats quite safe in consequence of their
superior management about the registration, such as Leeds
and Ripon, where they were sure of both members. He then
talked of the tactics to be used, and said they must direct
their hostility against the Whigs rather than the Radicals,
and make it their principal object to diminish the number of
the former. I said I thought this a very perilous game to
play, and that if it was avowed and acted upon, it would
infallibly produce a reunion between the Whigs and Radicals,
who would coalesce to crush their Government; that the
Radicals were now very angry with the Whigs, who they
thought had deserted the principles they professed, and it
should rather be their care to keep Whigs and Radicals
asunder than provoke a fresh alliance between them. He
said the Whigs were certain to join the Radicals. I asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
him if he had seen the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; said what had passed between
the Duke and me, and told him he would do well to endeavour
to obtain its support. He said he desired nothing so much,
but in his situation he did not like personally to interfere,
nor to place himself in their power. I told him I had some
acquaintance with Barnes, the editor of the paper, and would
find out what he was disposed to do, and would let him know,
which he entreated I would. The Duke had said, laughing,
&lsquo;I hear they call me a Reformer.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;They think you
will make as good a Reformer as the present men, if, as
Brougham said in Scotland, they would have done less this
session than they did the last.&rsquo; I asked Lyndhurst if he had
seen or heard of the Duke&rsquo;s letter to the Oxford people, and
told him that it was very desirable that credit should be
given them for intending to carry on their government upon
principles as liberal as that letter evinced, that I hoped there
would be no foolish declarations fulminated against Reform,
and that they would all be convinced now that matters had
been brought to such a state (no matter how and by whom)
that the old principle of hostility to all reforms must be abandoned.
He said that Peel would, he trusted, be <i>flexible</i>, that
if such declarations were made, and such principles announced,
they must be upset, but the Tories would be difficult
to manage, and discontented if there was not a sufficient
infusion of their party; and, on the other hand, the agricultural
interest had assembled a force under Lord Chandos, a
sort of confederation of several counties, and that Chandos
had told him that he and the representatives of their counties
would not support any Ministry that would not pledge
itself to repeal the malt tax; that they would agree to re-enact
the beer tax, but the malt tax must cease.</p>

<p>Brougham had written to Lyndhurst saying he should be
ready to resign the Great Seal in a few days, and only wished
first to give some judgments, that he was rejoiced at retiring
from office and at the prospect of being able to do what was
his great delight&mdash;devote himself to State affairs without
being trammelled and having to fear the imputation of imprudence
and indiscretion. &lsquo;He will be,&rsquo; Lyndhurst said, &lsquo;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LYNDHURST ON BROUGHAM.</span>
most troublesome fellow that ever existed, and do all the mischief
he can.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;What can he do? he was emasculated
when he left the House of Commons.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;he
knows that, but he will come down night after night and produce
plans of Reform upon any subject; he will make speeches
two or three hours long to very thin Houses, which will be
printed in all the newspapers or published by himself and
circulated&mdash;in fact, a series of pamphlets.&rsquo; I said that he
had damaged himself so much that I did not think he could
do a great deal of harm, with all his speeches and pamphlets.
He said he had damaged himself in more ways than one.
He then went off upon his admirable social qualities and his
generous conduct to his family, both of which may most justly
be praised, and said what a melancholy thing it was to see
a man with such fine talents mar their effect by his enormous
errors in judgment.</p>

<p>Lord Holland, who came out last of all his colleagues,
upon his crutches, stopped in great good-humour and said to
the Duke, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t get me out, I can tell you, without
going into Lancashire, for my seal is there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Duke told me that he did not mean to make the
slightest alteration in the transaction of the current business
in the different offices, which would go on as usual through
the under-secretaries, whom he should request to continue
at their posts for the purpose. As, however, a disposition
was evinced on the part of the late Cabinet not to
afford him any facilities, he began to think that this might
not impossibly extend to the subordinates, and he said that
at all events he would have two people ready to put into the
Treasury to transact the business there. I told him if he
was in any difficulty he might make any use he pleased of
me. There can hardly be any difficulty, however, when there
are permanent under-secretaries in all the offices.</p>

<p>Thus ended this eventful day; just four years ago I witnessed
the reverse of the picture. I think the Whigs upon this
occasion were much more angry and dejected than the Tories
were upon that. They had perhaps some reason, for their
case is one of rare occurrence&mdash;unceremoniously kicked out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not resignations following ineffectual negotiations or baffled
attempts at arrangement, but in the plenitude of their
fancied strength, and utterly unconscious of danger, they
were discarded in the most positive, summary, and peremptory
manner. Great, therefore, is their indignation, mortification,
and chagrin, and bitter will no doubt be their
opposition. They think that the new Government have no
chance of getting a House of Commons that will support
them, and certainly if they do not, and if the Tories are
compelled after a fruitless struggle to resign, miserable will
be the condition of the King and the House of Lords, and not
very enviable that of any Government that may succeed
them.</p>

<p>To speculate upon probabilities is impossible; the new
Government at present consists of the Duke, Lyndhurst, and
Peel, and till it shall be seen of what materials the complete
structure is composed, and what principles they enunciate,
it is idle to discuss the matter. Lyndhurst and I agreed
cordially that all the evils of the last four years&mdash;the breaking
up of their Government, and the Reform Bill that was the consequence
of that catastrophe&mdash;were attributable to the High
Tories. Whatever may be their wishes now, they can hardly
play the same game over again; they must support this
Government, even though it shall not act upon the highflying
principles which they so fondly and obstinately cherish.
Their salvation and that of all the institutions to which they
cling require that they should support the Duke and Peel
in carrying on the government upon those principles on
which, from the circumstances of the times and the events
which have occurred, an Administration <i>must</i> act in order
to have a shadow of a chance of being tolerated by the House
of Commons and the country. Lyndhurst is sensible of this;
I wish Peel may be so likewise. If they both are I have
little fear for the Duke.</p>

<h3>November 19th, 1834</h3>

<p>Laid up these two days with the gout
in my knee, so could not go out to hear what is going on.
The Duke, I find, after the Council on Monday (losing no
time), repaired to the Home Office and ordered the Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON IN OFFICE.</span>
papers to be brought to him, then to the Foreign Office,
where he asked for the last despatches from Spain and
Portugal, and so on to the Colonial Office, where he required
information as to the state of their department. I have no
doubt he liked this, to play the part of Richelieu for a brief
period, to exercise all the functions of administration. They
complain, however, and not without reason, of the unceremonious
and somewhat uncourteous mode in which without
previous notice he entered into the vacant offices, taking actual
possession, without any of the usual preliminary civilities to
the old occupants. Duncannon, who had been in the Home
Office up to the time of the Council on Monday, and whose
papers were unremoved, if he had returned after it, would
have found the Duke seated in his still warm chair, issuing
directions to Phillips, the under-secretary, while Macdonald,
Duncannon&rsquo;s private secretary, was still at his vocation in
the adjoining room. Pretty much the same thing he did in
the other three offices. He has fixed his head-quarters at
the Home Office, and occasionally roves over the rest. All
this is unavoidable under existing circumstances, but it is
enough to excite merriment, or censure, or suspicion,
according to different tastes and tempers. The King offered
to make Melbourne an earl and to give him the Garter, but
he declined, and begged it might be given to the Duke of
Grafton.</p>

<p>In consequence of what passed between Lyndhurst and
me concerning the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; (at St. James&rsquo;s) I made Henry de
Ros send for Barnes (who had already at his suggestion
adopted a conciliatory and amicable tone towards the embryo
Government), who came and put on paper the terms on
which he would support the Duke. These were: no mutilation
of the Reform Bill, and the adoption of those measures
of reform which had been already sanctioned by
votes of the House of Commons last session with regard to
Church and corporations, and no change in our foreign
policy. I have sent his note to Lyndhurst, and begged him
to call here to talk the matter over.</p>

<p>Powell, a Tory solicitor and <i>âme damnée</i> of the Speaker&rsquo;s,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
has just been here; he declares that the Tories will be 420
strong in the new Parliament, which I mention for the
purpose of recording their expectations and being able to
compare them hereafter with the event. They have already
put themselves in motion, despatched messengers to Lord
Hertford and Lowther, and probably if ever these men could
be induced to open their purse strings, and make sacrifices
and exertions, they will do it now.</p>

<p><i>Six o&rsquo;clock</i>.&mdash;Lyndhurst has just been here; he had seen
the Duke, who had already opened a negotiation with Barnes
through Scarlett. I offered to get any statement inserted
of the <i>causes</i> of the late break-up, and he will again see the
Duke and consider the propriety of inserting one. He said,
&lsquo;Why Barnes is the most powerful man in the country.&rsquo; The
&lsquo;Standard&rsquo; has sent to offer its support; the Duke said he
should be very happy, but they must understand that the
Government was not yet formed.</p>

<h3>November 21st, 1834</h3>

<p>To-day there was a Council at St.
James&rsquo;s, at which Lyndhurst was sworn in Chancellor.
Brougham took leave of the Bar this morning, and I hear
did it well. The King speechified as usual, and gave them
a couple of harangues; he said it was just four years since
he had very unwillingly taken the Seal from Lord Lyndhurst,
and he now had great pleasure in restoring it to him. He
was all King to-day&mdash;talked of having &lsquo;commanded the ex-Ministers
to retire;&rsquo; &lsquo;desired Lord Brougham to give up
the Seal,&rsquo; which is true, for the Duke wrote to him for it,
and instead of surrendering it in person Brougham sent it to
Sir Henry Taylor. The King compared this crisis with that
which befell his father in 1784, when he had placed the
government in the hands of the Marquis of Rockingham; he
said that the present was only a provisional arrangement,
but that there was this difference, that the country was now
in a state of excitement and disquiet, which it was free from
then, but that he had full reliance on the great firmness of
the Duke (here the Duke bowed); that the Administration
which was then formed had lasted seventeen years (of course
he meant that of Pitt, which succeeded the coalition), and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BROUGHAM ASKS FOR THE CHIEF BARONSHIP.</span>
he hoped that this which was about to be formed would last
as long, although at his time of life if it did he could not
expect to see the end of it.</p>

<h3>November 22nd, 1834</h3>

<p>I read Brougham&rsquo;s speech on quitting
the Court of Chancery this morning, and admirable it is&mdash;not
a syllable about himself, but with reference to the
appointment of Pepys, brief, dignified, and appropriate. <i>Si
sic omnia</i>, what a man he would be.</p>

<h3>November 23rd, 1834</h3>

<p>This morning I received a note from
Henry de Ros enclosing one from Barnes, who was evidently
much nettled at not having received any specific answer to
his note stating the terms on which he would support the
Duke. Henry was disconcerted also, and entreated me to
have an explanation with Lyndhurst. I accordingly went to
the Court of Exchequer, where he was sitting, and waited till
he came out, when I gave him these notes to read. He took
me away with him, and stopped at the Home Office to see the
Duke and talk to him on the subject, for he was evidently a
little alarmed, so great and dangerous a potentate is the
wielder of the thunders of the press. After a long conference
he came out and gave me a note the Duke had
written, saying he could not pledge himself nor Sir Robert
Peel (who was to be the Minister) before he arrived, and
eventually I agreed to draw up a paper explanatory of the
position of the Duke, and his expectations and views with
regard to the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; and its support. This I sent to him,
and he is to return it to me with such corrections as he
may think it requires, and it is to be shown to Barnes to-morrow.</p>

<p>On the way Lyndhurst told me an incredible thing&mdash;that
Brougham had written to him proposing that he should be
made Chief Baron, which would be a great saving to the
country, as he was content to take it with no higher salary
than his retiring pension and some provision for the expense
of the circuit. He said he would show me the letter, but
that he had left it with the Duke, so could not then. He
knows well enough that, whatever may be the fate of this
Government, he has no chance of recovering the Great Seal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
but I own I do not comprehend what object he can have in
taking this appointment, or what there is of importance
enough to induce him to apply for it to his political opponents,
and incur all the odium that would be heaped upon
him if the fact were generally known. He would not consider
himself tongue-tied in the House of Lords any more
than Lyndhurst was, for though the former took the situation
under a sort of condition, either positive or implied, that he
was to observe something like a neutrality, he considered
himself entirely emancipated from the engagement when
the great Reform battle began, and the consequence was
that the secret article in the treaty was also cancelled, and
Denman got the Chief Justiceship instead of him. I imagine
that the King would not agree to Brougham&rsquo;s being Chief
Baron even though the Duke and Lyndhurst should be
disposed to place him on the bench. There might be some
convenience in it. He must cut fewer capers in ermine than
in plaid trousers. [As might have been expected, this intended
stroke of Brougham&rsquo;s was a total failure. Friends
and foes condemn him; Duncannon tried to dissuade him;
the rest of his colleagues only knew of it after it was done.
Duncannon told me he neither desired nor expected that his
offer would be accepted.&mdash;<i>November 30th</i>.]</p>

<h3>November 24th, 1834</h3>

<p>I sent Lyndhurst a paper to be read to
Barnes, which he returned to me with another he had written
instead, which certainly was much better. The Duke&rsquo;s note
and this paper were read to him, and he expressed himself
quite satisfied, was much gratified by an offer Lyndhurst
made to see him, and proposed a meeting; so, then, I leave
the affair. I took a copy of Lyndhurst&rsquo;s paper, and then
returned it and the note to him.</p>

<p>At night I went to Holland House, where I found
Brougham, Lord John Russell, and Lord Lansdowne. Lady
Holland told me that she had been the channel of communication
by which the arrangement of giving the Chief Baronship
to Lyndhurst had been carried on, and she declared that
there was no secret article in it. I believe, however, that
there was one concluded between Brougham and Lyndhurst,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE WHIGS ON THE RECENT CHANGE.</span>
when they met to settle it in Burlington street. Leach
brought the original message from Alexander, who offered to
resign in favour of Lyndhurst. I hear of nothing but the
indignation of the ex-Ministers at the uncourteousness of the
Duke&rsquo;s conduct towards them; but though there is too much
truth, there is also some exaggeration in the complaints.
It is necessary to be on one&rsquo;s guard against what one hears,
as I verified yesterday in a particular case.</p>

<h3>November 26th, 1834</h3>

<p>Barnes is to dine with Lord Lyndhurst,
and a gastronomic ratification will wind up the treaty between
these high contracting parties. I walked home with Duncannon
last night; he declared to me that though he could
not tell me what did pass between the King and Melbourne,
what is stated to have passed is not the truth. I heard
elsewhere that the Whigs insist upon it there was no disunion
in the Cabinet, and that Lord Lansdowne and Rice
had seen the Irish Tithe Bill (the Irish Chancellor being the
supposed subject of disunion), and that they both agreed
to its provisions. Duncannon said that if the King had
insisted upon the dismissal of Brougham, and had consented
to go on with the rest, he would have put them in a grand
dilemma, for that such a requisition would have met the
concurrence of many of their friends and of the public. He
thinks Brougham would not have <i>resigned</i> even then, and
that it would have been very dangerous to turn him out.
All this speculation matters little now. He is thoroughly
convinced that the present appearances of indifference and
tranquillity in the country are delusive, and that the elections
will rouse a dormant spirit, and that the minor differences of
Reformers and Liberals of all denominations will be sunk in
a determined hostility to the Government of Peel and the
Duke. He says that the Irish Church must bring the question
between the two parties to an immediate and decisive
test; that if the new Government are beaten upon it, as he
thinks inevitable, out they must go; that the return of the
Government just broken up will be out of the question, and
the King must submit to receive one of still stronger measures.
Duncannon does not conceal the ultra-Liberal nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of his opinions, and he would not regret the accomplishment
of his predictions. It cannot be concealed that there is
nothing very improbable in them, although I am far from
regarding the event as so certain as he does; still less can I
partake of the blind confidence and sanguine hopes of the
Tories. One thing is, however, very clear, that the Whigs
and the Radicals will join (as Lyndhurst said they were sure
to do), and that they will both declare war to the knife against
the Tory Government. The best hope and chance is that
a number of really independent men, unpledged, may be
returned, who will hold something like a balance between
the extreme parties, resist all violent propositions, protect
the King from insult and peremptory dictation, and afford
the new Government a fair trial, and on the other hand
declare at once and without reserve their determination to
continue without interruption the course of rational and
effectual reform, making a virtual abandonment of High Tory
maxims and acquiescence in the desires of the country with
respect to the correction of abuses the indispensable conditions
of the present Government&rsquo;s retention of office.</p>

<h3>November 27th, 1834</h3>

<p>Yesterday Lord Wharncliffe came to me.
He had just been with the Duke, who received him very cordially,
and showed him the correspondence and minutes of
conversations between the King and Melbourne. He says
that it is evident that Melbourne despaired of being able to
carry on the Government, and that the gist of the King&rsquo;s
objection was the nomination of Lord John Russell to lead
the Government in the House of Commons, which His
Majesty said he could not agree to, because he had already
declared his sentiments with regard to the Church and his
resolution of supporting it to the bishops and on other occasions,
and that Lord John Russell had signalised himself in the
House of Commons by his destructive opinions with regard to
the Establishment. I should be glad to see this correspondence
and judge for myself, but I can&rsquo;t go to the Duke on
purpose. Wharncliffe says that he is quite satisfied from his
conversation that the Duke is thoroughly convinced of the
necessity of adopting a line of conduct in conformity with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POLICY OF THE PEEL GOVERNMENT.</span>
state of public opinion and determination in the country, and
that he is prepared to abandon (as far as he is concerned) the
old Tory maxims. So far so good; but there is no concealing
that, however this may (if Peel concurs) facilitate the formation
and secure the duration of the new Government, there
is a revolting inconsistency in it all, involving considerable
loss of character. He gave no indication of such a disposition
during the last session; it is all reserved for the period
when he is possessed of power. It is, however, at present
all very vague, and we shall see what his notion is of a
Liberal course of policy. I fear that he and Peel are both too
deeply committed on the Irish Church question to suffer
them to propose any compromise likely to be satisfactory
with regard to it, and then the difficulties of the question
are so enormous that it seems next to impossible to compose
them. The respective parties drive at different objects; one
wants to appropriate the surplus revenue, the other wants to
secure to the parsons their tithes, and while they are quarrelling
with unmitigable fierceness upon these points, the Irish
settle the question by refusing to pay any tithe, and by
evading every attempt that is made to procure the payment
in some other shape or under some other denomination.</p>

<p>The Duke told Wharncliffe that both he and the King were
fully aware of the importance of the step that his Majesty
had taken&mdash;that this is, in fact, the Conservatives&rsquo; last cast&mdash;and
that he (the King) is resolved neither to flinch nor
falter, but having embarked with them, to nail his flag to
the mast and put forth all the constitutional authority of
the Crown in support of the Government he is about to form.
I am strongly inclined to think that this determination,
when properly ascertained, will have considerable influence,
and that, provided a respectable and presentable Cabinet be
formed and Liberal measures adopted, they will succeed.
Though the Crown is not so powerful as it was, there probably
still remains a great deal of attachment and respect to
it, and if the King can show a fair case to the country, there
will be found both in Parliament and out of it a vast number
of persons who will reflect deeply upon the consequences of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
coming to a serious collision with the Throne, and consider
whether the exigency is such as to justify such extremities.
It may be very desirable to purify the Irish Church, to remodel
corporations, and to relieve the Dissenters in various
ways, and nobody can entertain a shadow of doubt that all
these things must and will be done; but the several cases
are not of great and pressing urgency. The fate of the
nation does not depend upon their being all accomplished
and arranged off-hand, and if the Government which the
King may form exhibits no spirit uncongenial to the public
feeling generally, and wars not with the genius of Reform,
which is dear to the people, it is my belief that a great
majority of the nation will shrink from the mere possibility
of a direct breach with the King, and from offering him
an insult in the shape of dictation and peremptory demand,
which he would consider himself bound in honour and in
conscience to resist.</p>

<p>I walked home with Duncannon at night, and I told him
this; he seemed struck by it, but still maintained that
Parliament would, in his opinion, not accept the new Ministry
on any terms. If Peel makes a High Tory Government, and
holds High Tory language, I think so too, and I can scarcely
hope that it should be otherwise. My mind, I own, misgives
me about Peel; I hope everything from his capacity and
dread everything from his character.</p>

<h3>November 28th, 1834</h3>

<p>This morning I got a letter from my
uncle the Duke of Portland, complaining of the Weights and
Measures Bill, and begging that, if possible, an Order in
Council might be passed suspending the operation of the
Act. I availed myself of this opportunity to see the Duke of
Wellington, and went to the Home Office to consult him on
the contents of this letter. After settling this business I
began about the recent negotiation between Lyndhurst and
Barnes, and this led to a discussion of the circumstances and
situation of affairs, in the course of which he told me everything
that had occurred. I asked him if <i>he</i> had sent the
&lsquo;Statement&rsquo; which appeared in the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo; He said no,
and that he was utterly at a loss to guess how they had got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE&rsquo;S ACCOUNT OF THE CRISIS.</span>
it, but that by whatever means it was as near as possible to
the truth. I said that this was utterly and peremptorily
denied by the other side, on which he called
Algy,<a name="FNA_25_02" id="FNA_25_02"></a><a href="#FN_25_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and desired
him to bring a letter which he had written to certain
Peers of his party&mdash;a circular&mdash;which he read to me.
In this he explained in general terms (without going into
particulars) the causes of the break-up of the late Government
and the advice he had given the King, and he told me
that he had got papers and letters in confirmation of every
word that he had written (Melbourne&rsquo;s correspondence with
the King and the minute of the conversation), all which he
said he would show me then, but that it would take up too
much time. However, as we proceeded to talk it over he
told me all that these papers contained, or at least all that
was material. The substance as I gathered it and as I
remember it was this:&mdash;Lord Melbourne had written to the
King and descanted on the great difficulty in which the
Government was placed in consequence of Lord Spencer&rsquo;s
death, and had intimated that the measures which he should
find it necessary to propose to him would produce a difference
of opinion in the Cabinet&mdash;in point of fact that it was, to
say the least, probable that Rice and Lansdowne would retire.
When he went down to Brighton, and they talked it over,
Lord Melbourne put it to his Majesty whether under existing
circumstances he would go on, placing himself in their hands,
or whether he would dispense with their services, only recommending
that if he resolved not to endeavour to go on
with this Government (with such modifications as circumstances
demanded) he would declare such resolution as
speedily as
possible.<a name="FNA_25_03" id="FNA_25_03"></a><a href="#FN_25_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The Duke says he did not actually
tender his or their resignations, did not throw up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Government, but <i>very near it</i>. The King suggested the
difficulty of his situation, and Melbourne told him &lsquo;he had
better send for the Duke of Wellington, and depend upon it
he would get him out of it.&rsquo; &lsquo;In fact,&rsquo; said the Duke,
&lsquo;Melbourne told him I should do just what I did.&rsquo; Accordingly
the King did send for the Duke, and it is true that
Melbourne offered to be the bearer of his Majesty&rsquo;s letter.
When some question was asked about the messenger,
Melbourne said, &lsquo;No messenger will go so quick as I shall;
you had better give it to me.&rsquo; The Duke said that no man
could have acted more like a gentleman and a man of honour
than Melbourne did, and that his opinion of him was greatly
raised. I told him that I thought Melbourne could not have
given his colleagues an exact and correct account of what
had passed, for that they could not conceive themselves to
have been so ill-treated if it was so, and that if he had told
them <i>all</i> they would probably have thought he had abandoned
their interests. He said that it was evident Melbourne was
very happy to disengage himself from the concern. (As all
this case will probably be discussed in Parliament, we shall
see that the debate will turn principally upon the fact of
disunion, and I have little doubt that Rice and Lansdowne
will declare that they had no intention of quitting. So much
depends upon verbal niceties, and the bounds between truth
and falsehood are so narrow, the partition so thin, that they
will, I expect, try to back up their party without any
absolute breach of veracity.) When the King was reading
the papers to him (the Duke), and telling him all that had
passed, <i>he was in a great fright</i> lest the Duke should think
he had acted imprudently, and should decline to accept the
Government. Then the Duke said, &lsquo;Sir, I see at once how
it all is. Your Majesty has not been left by your Ministers,
but something very like it;&rsquo; and His Majesty was rejoiced
when the Duke at once acquiesced in taking office.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_25_02" id="FN_25_02"></a><a href="#FNA_25_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[Mr. Algernon Greville, brother of Mr. Charles Greville, was private
secretary to the Duke of Wellington both in and out of office.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_25_03" id="FN_25_03"></a><a href="#FNA_25_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[This statement has certainly not been confirmed by the subsequent
publication of papers or by the narrative of the King himself. It is very
extraordinary that the Duke of Wellington should have been led to believe
it; but this is only another proof of the extreme difficulty of arriving at an
exact knowledge of what passes in conversation between two persons, even
when both of them are acting in perfect good faith.]</p></div>

<p>The Duke said he had received very satisfactory letters
from all (or many) of the Peers to whom he had written&mdash;from
the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Mansfield, the most violent
of the Tories. I said, &lsquo;Are they ready to place themselves
in your hands, and agree to whatever you may think it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD STANLEY&rsquo;S POSITION.</span>
necessary to do?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;I think they are; I think they
will do anything.&rsquo; He told me that affairs were left in a
wretched state in the Treasury, that the late Ministers were
no men of business, and minutes had been proposed to him
finding fault with various things; but he had refused to do
any such thing, and he would repair any error he could without
casting any blame on others. On the whole he thought
everything looked well, and that he should, when Peel arrived,
put the concern into his hands in a satisfactory state.</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear, in the midst of assertion on one side
and contradiction on the other, that in the first instance
there was neither plot nor plan on the part of the King or
anybody else. The death of Lord Spencer really did create
an enormous embarrassment, which Melbourne felt much
more than any of his colleagues; and though he told the
King &lsquo;that he was ready to go on with the Government if
such was his pleasure,&rsquo; he felt no desire to be taken at his
word, and no confidence or expectation that the arrangements
he proposed would be palatable to the King or of a
permanent nature. He seems to have been candid and
straightforward in all that he said, and to have contemplated
his dismissal as a very probable result of his correspondence
and conversations with his Majesty. The Irish Church has
evidently caused <i>the split</i>; the intended reforms in it and
the elevation of Lord John Russell to the post of leader were
more than the King could digest. I wish I had seen the
papers, for the sake of knowing what it is they proposed to
the King, and how far he was disposed to go.</p>

<h3>November 29th, 1834</h3>

<p>I told the Duke yesterday what I had
learnt from George Bentinck (and he from the Duke of Richmond)
of Lord
Stanley&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_25_04" id="FNA_25_04"></a><a href="#FN_25_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
disposition. He is not at all desirous
to be mixed up in the new concern, but has no objection to take
office under Peel, and he is ready to <i>listen</i> to any proposition
that may be made to him; but he is very much afraid of being
accused of dereliction of principle by his old colleagues and
friends. It is clear, therefore, that he would reject any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
overture unless it included an agreement that the Government
should be conducted upon Liberal principles, and unless
his friends were invited to join the Government with him.
The Duke took very little notice of this.</p>

<h3>December 1st, 1834</h3>

<p>Went to St. Paul&rsquo;s yesterday evening, to
hear Sydney Smith preach. He is very good; manner impressive,
voice sonorous and agreeable, <i>rather</i> familiar, but
not offensively so, language simple and unadorned, sermon
clever and illustrative. The service is exceedingly grand,
performed with all the pomp of a cathedral and chanted
with beautiful voices; the lamps scattered few and far
between throughout the vast space under the dome, making
darkness visible, and dimly revealing the immensity of the
building, were exceedingly striking. The Cathedral service
thus chanted and performed is my <i>beau idéal</i> of religious
worship&mdash;simple, intelligible, and grand, appealing at the
same time to the reason and the imagination. I prefer it
infinitely to the Catholic service, for though I am fond of
the bursts of music and the clouds of incense, I can&rsquo;t endure
the undistinguishable sounds with which the priest mumbles
over the prayers.</p>

<p>I heard yesterday that there has been a breeze between
Duncannon and Melbourne, arising out of his speech at
Derby. This was in answer to an address they voted him,
and it was exceedingly temperate and reserved. In the
course of it he said that &lsquo;he had no personal cause of complaint.&rsquo;
A warfare has been raging between the &lsquo;Standard&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;Chronicle&rsquo; about what passed, and the articles in the
latter have been supplied by Duncannon or some of them;
these are at variance with Melbourne&rsquo;s avowal, and they
are very angry with him for what he said, and want him to
make some statement (or to authorise one) of a different
kind and more corresponding with their own declarations
and complaints. This he refuses to do, and they have been
squabbling about it with some vivacity. All this induces me
the more to think that Melbourne has never told his colleagues
how very easily and contentedly he gave up the
reins of Government, not intending to deceive them, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD LYNDHURST&rsquo;S DINNER TO MR. BARNES.</span>
from a desire to avoid exasperating people whom he found
so much disturbed and so bitter.</p>

<h3>December 2nd, 1834</h3>

<p>Dined with Lord Lyndhurst yesterday;
the dinner for Mr. Barnes. He had collected a miscellaneous
party, droll enough&mdash;Mrs. Fox, Baron Bolland, Follett,
Hardinge, &amp;c. The Duke and Lord Chandos were to have
been there. Barnes told Hardinge there was a great cry
getting up in the country against the Duke. After dinner
I had a long conversation with Hardinge, on the whole satisfactory.
He said that he had been instrumental in bringing
the Duke and Peel together again, after a considerable coldness
and estrangement had existed between them; that after
the failure in May 1832, when Peel refused to have anything
to do with the concern, he had called upon him and insisted
upon taking him to Apsley House and spontaneously consulting
with the Duke how he should withdraw from the
business; that with great difficulty he had persuaded him,
and together they went, from which time the Duke and he
have again become friends. He is convinced that Peel will at
once make a fair and cordial overture to Stanley, and thinks
it of the greatest importance that Stanley&rsquo;s disposition and
probable demands should be ascertained before Peel arrives.
I told him what I had before told the Duke, and what I
had reason to believe were Stanley&rsquo;s sentiments. He asked
whether Stanley would insist upon Richmond and Ripon
coming in with him; he said that for the former he (Hardinge)
was sure Peel would never admit him without the
Duke&rsquo;s full and especial consent, which, however, he has no
doubt the Duke would give without hesitation, and overlook
any personal cause of offence, to facilitate a desirable
arrangement; that there was some dispute among his friends
whether it would be better that Stanley should join now or
only support (if he would) at first and join afterwards. I
said, &lsquo;Unquestionably it is better he should join at once,&rsquo; to
which Hardinge assented, though he added that many
thought otherwise, that if Stanley made difficulties and
declined the junction, he was persuaded Peel would keep
nothing open, and would not make provisional arrangements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to admit him and his party when they should think
it more safe and convenient to unite their future to his.
What they would like evidently is to take Stanley and
Graham and wash their hands of Ripon and Richmond, but
I think they will be forced to admit them all, for Lyndhurst
owned to me that he did not think they could stand without
Stanley; and the King is so anxious for it that if Stanley
insists on terms which are not very unreasonable (under
the circumstances) they will not be refused. Hardinge
said that four seats in the Cabinet would be a large share,
but that the best men among them were prepared to make
every sacrifice of their own just expectations or claims to
render any arrangement feasible that circumstances might
require, that &lsquo;all was right with the Speaker,&rsquo; and as for
the High Tories, the sooner they cut the connection with
them the better, but that they (the High Tories) were now
at their feet.</p>

<p>He then went into the details of the King&rsquo;s case with his
late Ministers&mdash;much to the same effect as I had before heard
from the Duke and Lyndhurst, but perhaps rather more
clearly. He said that Melbourne had stated to the King that
questions must soon be brought under the consideration of the
Cabinet relating to the Irish Church on which a considerable
difference of opinion prevailed, and that if the opinion of the
majority of the Cabinet should be acquiesced in by his
Majesty, the secession of two or more members of it would
in all probability follow; that if the desire of his Majesty to
compromise these differences of opinion and prevent any
separation should have the effect of preventing such discussions
in the Cabinet as should lead to any disunion <i>for
the time</i>, it was only fair and right to own to him that it
would be in the power of any member of the House of
Commons who should become acquainted with the difference
of opinion which prevailed to bring the question to an issue;
and if such a thing should occur, the resignations, he apprehended,
would only be retarded. The King, under these
circumstances, asked how he proposed to fill up the vacancies
that would thus occur, whether from any but what is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR H. HARDINGE ON THE LATE CRISIS.</span>
the extreme party, and whether he (Melbourne), with a
knowledge of the King&rsquo;s sentiments, could advise him to
have recourse to Lord Durham and others of the same
opinions. Melbourne acknowledged that he could look nowhere
else, and that he certainly could not give the King
such advice, upon which he said that as the breach sooner
or latter appeared inevitable, he thought it better that the
dissolution of the Government should take place at once,
and he preferred making the change during the recess,
when he should have time to form other arrangements,
rather than have it forced upon him during all the excitement
of the session of Parliament. This, I think, was the
pith of the thing, and in my opinion it forms a good case.
Hardinge said that if the King had been a clever man he
would have postponed his decision and spun out the
correspondence, in the course of which he would have acquired
pretexts sufficient. This, however, explains what the other
side means by insisting that there was <i>no difference</i> of
opinion in the Cabinet; there was none <i>actual</i>, but it was
on the prospective disunion so clearly announced to the
King, and impending at such an indefinite and probably
inconvenient time, that he took his resolution. Melbourne
appears to have been bullied into a sort of exculpatory letter
on account of his speech at Derby, saying that he spoke of
having no personal cause of complaint because the King was
very civil to him.</p>

<h3>December 5th, 1834</h3>

<p>The dinner that Lyndhurst gave to
Barnes has made a great uproar, as I thought it would. I
never could understand the Chancellor&rsquo;s making such a
display of this connexion, but whatever he may be as a
lawyer, and how great soever in his wig, I suspect that
he is deficient in knowledge of the world and those nice
calculations of public taste and opinion which are only to
be acquired by intuitive sagacity exercised in the daily
communion of social life.</p>

<p>Melbourne has had to make another speech, which smells
of the recent reproaches of his colleagues; without exactly
recanting what he had said, he has amplified, modified, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
explained, so as to chime in to a certain degree with their
assertions.</p>

<p>Brougham has been made to recall his letter offering to
be Chief Baron. It matters not what he does for the present;
his star is totally eclipsed, but not, I think, for ever quenched;
his vast abilities must find scope and produce effect. It
is true he can never thoroughly inspire confidence, but if
adversity teaches him wisdom, and cools the effervescence of
his temper and imagination, nothing can prevent his political
resurrection, thought not in &lsquo;all his original brightness.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>December 6th, 1834</h3>

<p>The Chancellor called on me yesterday
about getting young Disraeli into Parliament (through the
means of George
Bentinck)<a name="FNA_25_05" id="FNA_25_05"></a><a href="#FN_25_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
for Lynn. I had told him
George wanted a good man to assist in turning out William
Lennox, and he suggested the above-named gentleman,
whom he called a friend of Chandos. His political principles
must, however, be in abeyance, for he said that Durham was
doing all he could to get him by the offer of a seat, and so
forth; if, therefore, he is undecided and wavering between
Chandos and Durham, he must be a mighty impartial
personage. I don&rsquo;t think such a man will do, though just
such as Lyndhurst would be connected with.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_25_05" id="FN_25_05"></a><a href="#FNA_25_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[Lord George Bentinck was member for Lynn Regis. It is curious that
this, the first mention of Mr. Disraeli in political life, should have originated
with the man who afterwards became his most powerful coadjutor and
ally.]</p></div>

<p>Melbourne&rsquo;s two speeches at Derby, and the history connected
with them, exhibit him in a very discreditable and
lamentable point of view&mdash;compelled by the menaces and
reproaches of Duncannon and the rest to eat his words;
and all this transacted by a sort of negotiation and through
the mediation of his vulgar secretary, Tom Young, and Mrs.
Lane Fox. Such a thing it is to be without firmness and decision
of character. Melbourne is a gentleman, liberal and
straightforward, with no meanness, and incapable of selfish
trickery and intrigue, but he is habitually careless and <i>insouciant</i>,
loves ease, and hates contests and squabbles, and
though he would never tell a lie, he has probably not that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN RUSSELL&rsquo;S SPEECH AT TOTNESS. </span>
stern and rigid regard for truth which would make him run
any risk rather than that of concealing anything or suffering
a false impression to be formed or conveyed with respect to
any matter he might be concerned in.</p>

<p>Lyndhurst told me that Peel&rsquo;s letter was short and
cautious, but satisfactory. He (Lyndhurst) is doing all he
can to draw closer the connexion between the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; and
the Government, and communicates constantly with Barnes.
He said they must make a liberal and comprehensive Government,
and sketched an outline of such a Cabinet as he would
like&mdash;four Stanleys, six of their own people, and two High
Tories, Chandos certainly, and Knatchbull probably; but even
if Stanley&rsquo;s other scruples can be got over, how he is to be
induced to unite with Chandos and Knatchbull or any such
men I guess not. However, the time is drawing very near.</p>

<h3>December 7th, 1834</h3>

<p>In a letter from the Duke of Portland to
George Bentinck yesterday he says that the Duke of Newcastle
had been there the day before, had talked politics, and declared
that in his opinion the leaders of his party ought not to give
way upon any one point. This is so different from what the
Duke of Wellington understood from his letter to him that
I sent the letter to the Duke, and afterwards I met him.
He said he thought the Duke of Portland must be mistaken,
for the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s letter to him was quite in another
sense. This is one of the silliest of the High Tories, but
there will yet be some trouble with the tribe. John Russell,
in a speech somewhere, has made assertions still more positive
and unqualified than Melbourne&rsquo;s, which, if correct,
throw over the King and his case. There is a fearful lie
somewhere, which I suppose will come out in time. It is
impossible to make up one&rsquo;s mind in the midst of statements
so different and yet so positive. George Bentinck sent to
Sturges Bourne to know if he would come in for Lynn, but
he declined. Disraeli he won&rsquo;t hear of.</p>

<h3>December 8th, 1834</h3>

<p>I read John Russell&rsquo;s speech at Totness
last night; it was a very masterly performance, suitable to
the occasion, and effective. He endeavoured to establish
these points: first, that the Duke of Wellington had continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
opposed all Reform measures and been the enemy
of all Reform principles; secondly, that they (the late
Government) had done a great deal, without doing too much;
and thirdly, that there really had occurred no circumstances
in the Cabinet, or with the King, sufficient to account for
their summary dismissal. There is no denying that his first
position is incontrovertible, that he makes out a very fair
case for his second, and his argument on the third throws
great doubt upon the matter in my mind, having previously
had no doubt that the King had a good case to show to the
world. It is not so much the Duke&rsquo;s opposition to this or
that particular measure, but the whole tenor of his conduct
and opinions, which it puts one in despair to look at. There
would be no gross inconsistency in his maintaining our foreign
relations in their present state, notwithstanding his repeated
attacks upon Palmerston&rsquo;s policy. He need not refuse to
suffer any legislative interference with the Church, English
or Irish, merely because he opposed the Tithe Bill last year
(great, by the way, as I always thought that blunder was, and
as events will prove it to have been), but in his opposition
to the one or the other we look in vain for some saving
declaration to prove that it is to the specific measure he is
hostile, and not to the principles from which it emanates. If
he now comes into office with a resolution to carry on the
investigations that have been set on foot, and to propose
various measures of reform in consequence of them, however
wisely he may act in bending to circumstances, there is
no escaping from the fact that his conduct in opposition and
in office is as different as light from darkness, and that he
adopts when in office those principles in the gross which he
utterly repudiates and opposes with all his might when he
is out. I should like much to have a conversation with the
Duke, and (if it were possible to speak so freely to him) to
set before him all the <i>apparent</i> inconsistencies of his conduct,
to trace his political career step by step, and tell him concisely
all that he may have read scattered through a hundred
newspapers, and then hear what he would say, what his
notions are of political honour and consistency, and how he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">INCONSISTENCIES OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.</span>
reconciles his general conduct with these maxims. I am
persuaded that he deludes himself by some process of extraordinary
false reasoning, and that the habits of intense
volition, jumbled up with party prejudices, old associations,
and exposure to never-ceasing flattery, have produced the
remarkable result we see in his conduct; notwithstanding the
enormous blunders he has committed, and his numerous and
flagrant inconsistencies, he has never lost his confidence in
himself, and what is more curious, has contrived to retain
that of a host of followers. In each particular act, and on
every fresh occasion, there appear in him a decision, singleness
of purpose, and straightforwardness which are inseparable
from a conviction of being in the right, and he never
seems to apprehend for a moment that he can be liable to
the imputation of any selfish or dishonourable motive. And
strange and paradoxical as it may appear, I do not think he
is justly liable to it except when he is under the influence of
some strong personal feeling. Such was his jealousy and
dislike of Canning, and this led him into perhaps the most
enormous of all his political misdeeds, the overthrow of the
Corn Bill of 1827. Upon other occasions I attribute his
conduct to the circumstance of his being governed by one
leading idea, and to his incapability of taking enlarged and
comprehensive views of political affairs, such as embrace not
only the complex relations of the present, but the ostensible
probabilities of the future. His judgment, instead of being
determined by profound habits of reflection, an extensive
knowledge of history, and accurate acquaintance with human
nature, seems to be wholly influenced by his own wishes and
his own conception of what the exigencies of the moment
require. It would not be difficult, I think, and perhaps I
may hereafter attempt to apply this delineation of his disposition
to the events of his life, and to show how the leading
idea in his mind has been the constant guide which he has
followed, sometimes to the detriment of the best interests of
the country and sometimes to that of his own reputation.</p>

<h3>December 10th, 1834</h3>

<p>Sir Robert arrived yesterday morning at
eight o&rsquo;clock. Great was the bustle among his clan; there
were the Ross&rsquo;s, the Plantas, and all of them pacing before his
door while he was still closeted with the Duke. Sefton came
up to town last night, and declares that Lord Stanley has
announced his intention of supporting Wood for Lancashire
and opposing Francis Egerton, which, if true, is ominous
against a junction with Peel.</p>

<h3>December 11th, 1834</h3>

<p>A Council yesterday. The King insisted
upon giving Peel the seal of the Exchequer in Council,
though it was not necessary. His object was to make a
speech. The Chief Justice, who was trying a cause at
Westminster, kept us waiting, and at last a carriage was sent
to fetch him. Peel made his first appearance full of spirits
and cordiality to the numerous greetings which hailed him.
He told me that he had seen the letter which I had written
to his brother Jonathan, that he agreed to every word of it,
and that he had written to Stanley in exact conformity to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD STANLEY DECLINES TO JOIN SIR R. PEEL.</span>
what I had said. This was a letter I had written to Jonathan
Peel, giving him an account of the state of things here, and
expressing at some length my own view of Peel&rsquo;s situation
and of what he ought to do. When Sir Robert got to Paris he
gave it to him, and as he approves of it I am certain that
his Government will be liberal enough; but then the Irish
Church! Stanley&rsquo;s answer may come to-day, but they expect
him in town at all events. When Denman arrived at
St. James&rsquo;s he had an audience and gave up the seal. The
Council was assembled, and the King, who had got his
speech all ready, first asking the Duke of Wellington if he
should go on, to which the Duke assented, delivered himself
&lsquo;in apt and gracious terms.&rsquo; It really was (however superfluous)
not at all ill done, recapitulating what everybody
knows, declaring that Sir Robert Peel was now Minister of
this country, and thanking the Duke of Wellington in his
own name and in that of the country for the part he had
taken and for the manner in which he had conducted the
public business during the interval; he said that he should
request him to hold the seals of the three offices for a few
days longer. He was not ridiculous to-day. With regard to
Lynn, I have handed George Bentinck over to William Peel
and Granville Somerset, and so washed my hands of it.</p>

<h3>December 13th, 1834</h3>

<p>Stanley has declined; I know not in what
terms, but it is said courteous. Now, then, nothing remains
but a Tory Government; the Whigs are triumphant that
Stanley will have nothing to do with it. Lord Grey, who
was moderate, has been lashed into fury by their putting
up Liddell for Northumberland. Charles Grey at Holland
House the other night threw them all into dismay by the
language he held&mdash;&lsquo;that if the Duke and Peel followed his
father&rsquo;s steps, and adopted Liberal measures, he should support
them.&rsquo; Lady Holland was almost in fits, and Allen in
convulsions.</p>

<h3>December 14th, 1834</h3>

<p>Lord Wharncliffe, to his great joy, was
sent for by Peel yesterday, and very civilly invited to join the
new Cabinet. He thought it necessary to enquire if he meant
to be liberal, and on receiving an assurance to that effect he at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
once consented. Graham was with Peel, having come up to
town on getting his letter, but he declined joining. Wharncliffe
told me that the correspondence between Peel and
Stanley was extremely civil. The Cabinet is now pretty
nearly completed; they all dined together at Peel&rsquo;s yesterday.
I asked Wharncliffe how Sir Edward Knatchbull was to be
converted into a Liberal, and he said, &lsquo;Oh, there will be no
difficulty; he is very reasonable.&rsquo; It would be (to me) a
bitter pill to swallow to take Knatchbull; he is the man who
led that section of High Tories which threw out the Duke&rsquo;s
Government in 1830. The Whigs are sorry that Graham
does not join, for they hate him and want to be rid of him.
They are also discomposed at a letter of Stanley&rsquo;s in reply to
an address to the King from Glasgow that has been forwarded
to him to present, in which his sentiments appear to be
alarmingly Conservative.</p>

<p>Stanley and Graham will support the Government, and
it now appears that the Duke of Wellington is the real
obstacle to their joining. To Peel Stanley has no objection;
he has spoken of him in the highest terms; but after the
speech which the Duke made when Lord Grey went out, in
which he attacked him and his Government with a virulence
which gave great disgust at the time, Stanley feels that he
could not with any regard to his own honour, and compatibly
with his respect and attachment for Lord Grey, form a part
of this Government. So there is another evil resulting from
one of those imprudences which the Duke blurts out without
reflection, thinking only of the present time and acting upon
his impulse at the moment. Spring Rice, whom I met yesterday,
said that their great object (in which they hoped to
succeed) was to keep the whole of their party together&mdash;their
party in the House of Commons, of course. Whether he included
Stanley in this or not I don&rsquo;t know, but if he did he
reckons probably without his host.</p>

<h3>December 15th, 1834</h3>

<p>Met the Duke of Richmond yesterday,
who came to town for the cattle show, and had a long talk
with him; he said they had discussed the whole matter (Stanley,
Graham, and himself) at Knowsley, and decided not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF RICHMOND AND SIR E. KNATCHBULL.</span>
join; that the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s violent speech against
all the members of the late Government and their policy made
it quite impossible, but that they were determined to support
Peel if they possibly could; and he seems not apprehensive
there would be any difficulty; he thinks Stanley&rsquo;s support out
of office will be more valuable than if he had joined them, and
perhaps under the above circumstances (for I had forgotten
the Duke&rsquo;s speech) it may be. Nothing can be more satisfactory
than the state of feeling between them all; and
certainly all those who would have followed Stanley, had
he taken office, may find as strong motives for supporting
Government now as they could have done then. I told
Richmond I thought Knatchbull was so High a Tory that I
did not see how they could make him a Liberal. He said
he was not at all strongly anti-Liberal, and that he had had
the option of being a member of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Government,
he having been himself commissioned to offer him the
Secretaryship at War. This, however, it is very clear, was
offered as a reward for the service he had done in giving the
mortal thrust to the Duke, and as he is an honest man, and
wanted at that time the Duke&rsquo;s life rather than his purse,
he was probably satisfied with his exploit, and never would
have done on any terms (what Richmond and others did) so
inconsistent a thing as to join a Reform Ministry. It is,
however, remarkable that this should have occurred. See
what it was. Knatchbull, a High Tory, turns out the Duke
and a Tory Government, and lets in the Whigs; he is offered
office by the Whig Minister to whose triumph he has been
instrumental, refuses it; and afterwards, on the exclusion of
the same Whig Ministry, is offered office by the returning
Tory Government, which he had four years ago destroyed,
and takes it.</p>

<h3>December 16th, 1834</h3>

<p>A great field-day at Court yesterday;
all the new Ministers sworn in, except the Colonial Secretary,
who is not yet appointed, and some subordinate officers. The
King addressed each of them on his kissing hands, and to
Scarlett he made a very pretty speech about the administration
of the law. Lord Rosslyn was substituted for Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Aberdeen (only in the morning) as President of the Council;
why did not appear, but I had learnt from Hardinge (in a
conversation I had with him) that the arrangements would
in some respects be only temporary, and made with a view
to the subsequent admission of Stanley and his party; the
nature of their communications has been such as to afford
a very fair prospect of that junction. Peel is much elated
at having got Sugden to go to Ireland as Chancellor. Lord
de Grey has been asked to be Lord-Lieutenant. I find Stanley
in his letter to Peel said that the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s
speech was an obstacle to his joining the Government.
These scruples they think unreasonable; and they allege his
own thimblerig speech, which was more violent against the
Whig Government and more insulting than anything the
Duke said; but they should comprehend that this speech
forms one of the ingredients of the difficulty, as it in fact
hampers his political conduct by putting him on uncomfortable
personal terms with his old friends.</p>

<h3>December 20th, 1834</h3>

<p>Peel&rsquo;s letter to his constituents has appeared
as his manifesto to the country; a very well written
and ingenious document, and well calculated to answer the
purpose, if it can be answered at all. The letter was submitted
to the Cabinet at a dinner at Lyndhurst&rsquo;s on
Wednesday last, and they sat till twelve o&rsquo;clock upon it,
after which it was copied out, a messenger despatched to the
three great newspapers (&lsquo;Times,&rsquo; &lsquo;Herald,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Post&rsquo;) to
announce its arrival, and at three in the morning it was
inserted. The Whigs affect to hold it very cheap, and to
treat it as an artful but shallow and inefficient production.
It is rather too Liberal for the bigoted Tories, but all the
moderate people are well satisfied with it. Of course it has
made a prodigious sensation, and nobody talks of anything
else.</p>

<h3>December 24th, 1834</h3>

<p>Dined yesterday at the Mansion House;
never having before seen a civic feast, I thought this a good
opportunity. The Egyptian Hall is fine enough; the other
rooms miserable. A great company, and all Tories almost.
The Lord Mayor boasted of his impartiality, and how he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROSPECTS OF THE MINISTRY.</span>
invited all parties alike, but none of the Whigs would go.
Peel spoke tolerably, but not so well as I expected; manly
enough and in good tone. In the speeches of the others there
was nothing remarkable. Ward made a violent speech,
attacking Grote and Lushington, though not by name. The
loyal party in the City are making great exertions, and
they expect to bring in three out of the four members,
which I doubt, not because I know anything of the matter,
but because they are generally out in their calculations.
In the meantime the vacant places have been gradually filled
up, and generally with Tories of a bad description&mdash;e.g.
Roden<a name="FNA_26_01" id="FNA_26_01"></a><a href="#FN_26_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
as Lord Steward, which, though no political situation,
would do harm merely from his name appearing in the
list. It never will be believed that such men as he&mdash;bigoted
and obstinate, and virtuous moreover&mdash;will consent to join
Peel if he has resolved to act upon principles diametrically
the reverse of those they have ever sustained, and they persist
(the Whigs) in asserting that every fresh appointment
of this kind is a new pledge that he means to govern on Tory
principles.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_26_01" id="FN_26_01"></a><a href="#FNA_26_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Roden refused on account of his health.&mdash;<i>January 4th</i>.</p></div>

<p>A few days ago I fell in with Hobhouse, and he walked
with me to my office. He told me that he and his fellow
Committee men at Ellice&rsquo;s, astonished at the confident expectations
of the Carltonians as to the result of a dissolution,
went over the list scrupulously and jealously, and resolved
to know the worst; that after making every allowance they
could, and excluding all doubtful places and all Stanleyites,
they found themselves with a majority of 195 votes, and
deducting from that 50 men who might be Waverers, and on
whom it might not be safe to count, they still found 145,
which they saw no possibility of disputing. On the other
hand the Conservatives, without going to actual numbers,
retain their confidence, though I confess I do not think on
any sufficient grounds as far as present appearances go.
As far as I can judge by the slight indications which reach
me, the managers of the late Government are acting with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
great dexterity, and I begin to think that Rice&rsquo;s expectation
of being able to hold together the whole of those who are
not with the new Government is not so chimerical as I at
first imagined. Although there is a little feeling for the
ex-Ministry and no excitement in the country, there is a
calm which is quite as alarming to the hopes of one party as
it is represented to be expressive with regard to the power
of the other, for unless some enthusiasm can be created,
some loyal motion to disturb the inertia of the mass, it must
be considered as standing much in the same situation as
before, and that certainly is not one favourable to the desires
and pretensions of the Conservative Government. Then
within this day or two there appear indications of a disposition
to hold off on the part of Stanley and Graham, if not to
join with their old friends, which might well alarm any
watchful and anxious mind. Stanley&rsquo;s speech at Glasgow
contained not a syllable expressive of regard for the royal
prerogative, or of respect for Peel, or of a disposition to try
the new Government, but extravagant compliments to Lord
Grey, and Whig language generally. I asked Hardinge last
night what he thought of it, and he said it struck him as
&lsquo;too Whiggish.&rsquo; I then told him that I was struck in like
manner, and that I had seen a letter from Graham in the
morning, the tone of which I did not at all like. It was to
George Bentinck about the Lynn election, for which he
was to endeavour to find a man, and failed. He said that
Stanley&rsquo;s speech was very good; blamed the composition
of the New Government, which would not give satisfaction,
though it must always be remembered that Peel had made
use of the old materials because he could not procure new
ones; said that people were now beginning to discover that
the Whigs need not be reduced to the alternative of joining
with the Radicals or the Tories, and that when a standard
was set up (Stanley&rsquo;s of course) on Conservatively Liberal
principles he thought plenty would be found to join it. It
is, therefore, very questionable what course Stanley will
pursue, even though a party may range itself under him,
which I doubt, and no position can be much worse than this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROSPECTS OF THE ELECTION.</span>
Government would be in if they were to hold office at his
discretion, and only while he should be pleased to throw his
weight into their scale. As far as one can judge his weight
will be small, for it is very remarkable that while for some
weeks George Bentinck has been endeavouring to find a
Stanleyite candidate for Lynn, who would be brought in
without trouble or expense, though he has ransacked the
Bar and applied to Richmond, Ripon, Graham, and Stanley
himself, no such man can be found. There are Whigs and
Tories in abundance, but not one man who will come into
Parliament as a follower of Stanley and owing his seat to
the patronage of the Duke of Richmond.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to consider Peel&rsquo;s speech at the Mansion
House less Liberal in tone and indicative of less confidence
than his letter to Tamworth. I don&rsquo;t perceive much difference.
Lord Roden has refused to be Lord Steward, but
the invitation has done the mischief. Lord Haddington goes
to Ireland, after making many difficulties, but finishing by
liking the appointment. Both parties remain equally confident
as to the result of the elections; the Whigs, as it appears
to me, with greater reason, and as the resolution of the
allies (the Whigs and Radicals) is to throw out the Government
as speedily as possible, and without caring for consequences,
I don&rsquo;t see how they ever can stand. The other night at
Holland House, Mulgrave, who is one of the leading men of
the electioneering committee, admitted that he did not see
what was to follow the overthrow of the Government, but
that the difficulty was one of their own creating; others of
them assert that Melbourne or Spencer will return, and
another Whig Government be formed, but they leave out of
calculation that the Radicals with whom they have joined
will not suffer themselves to be brushed off when done with,
nor will the Tories come down to assist them if they endeavour
again to make head against the Radicals. The
Tories have shown themselves a reckless and desperate party,
and I see no reason for supposing that their conduct will
belie their character; they overthrow their friends from revenge,
and will hardly save their enemies from charity; their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
interest, their real interest, they seem destined ever to be
blind to. There may be a hope that, having put themselves
under the orders of Peel, they will act in a body as he shall
direct them, and if so they may be a powerful and useful
Opposition, and I really believe that he will not turn his eyes
from the true interests of the country, or cease to regard all
those contingencies which may, under dexterous management,
be eventually turned to account. It is, however, impossible
not to feel greatly disquieted at the aspect of affairs&mdash;at the
mixture of bad spirit and apathy that prevails, for I consider
the apathy an evil and not a good sign. Those who
express most loudly their alarm and abhorrence of ultra
doctrines make little exertion, personal or pecuniary, to stem
their torrent. There have been some great examples of
liberality. I heard only the other day that the Duke of
Buccleuch subscribed 20,000&#8467;. for the election of 1831; Lord
Harrowby (a poor man) has given l,000&#8467;. for this. The
fact is, it is in politics to a certain degree as in religion.
Men fear in the one case in the same manner as they believe
in the other; they have some doubts in both cases, but no
convictions. Their conduct belies their assertions, and when
compared with that which they observe on occasions where
there is no room for doubt, it will be seen that their want
of energy or decision, their various inconsistencies, proceed
from self-deceit, which is just strong enough to permit them
to try and deceive others with actual falsehood and hypocrisy.</p>

<h3>December 28th, 1834</h3>

<p>My brother Henry came from Paris a day
or two ago to take the place of <i>précis</i> writer in the Foreign
Office. Just before he started old Pozzo gave him a whole
string of messages to the Duke of Wellington, adding that
he would give the world for an hour&rsquo;s conversation with
him. These communications were evidently made upon a
supposition that their opinions were generally congenial.
He said that the affairs of Belgium required particular attention;
that the Belgians were grown insolent, and meant, by
deferring a final settlement, to avoid paying their portion of
the debt and to keep the disputed Duchies, and that <i>unfortunately</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STATE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</span>
the conduct of the King of Holland had not been
such as to entitle him to assistance; that in Germany the
spirit was good and tranquillity prevailed; in Spain nothing
could be worse, and he told the Duke to be on his guard
against what Alava should say to him, &lsquo;qui n&rsquo;avait pas le
sens commun, mais qui était dévoué au Duc,&rsquo; and that he
might <i>endoctriner</i> him a little. Henry took a memorandum
of this and gave it to the Duke; but however disposed
he may be to enter into Pozzo&rsquo;s views, he will probably
soon be obliged to take a tone very unpleasant to Russia,
for I find that the affairs of Turkey are in such a state that
they are to be brought under the immediate consideration of
the Cabinet. The great object of the late Government was
(and that of this Government must be the same) to get the
Porte out of the clutches of Russia. The Sultan is a mere
slave of the Emperor, but throughout his dominions, and the
Principalities likewise, a bitter feeling of hatred against Russia
prevails. Our policy has been to induce the Sultan to throw
off the yoke&mdash;by promises of assistance on one hand, and
menaces on the other of supporting Mehemet Ali against
him. Hitherto, however, the Sultan has never been induced
to bestir himself. It is evident that if this matter is taken
up seriously, and with a resolution to curb the power of
Russia in the East, the greatest diplomatic judgment and
firmness will be requisite in our Ambassador at St. Petersburg;
and how under these circumstances the Duke can send
Londonderry, and how Peel can have consented to his nomination,
I am at a loss to conceive. It appears just worse than
what Palmerston did, which was to send nobody at all. In
all this complication of interests in the East, France is ready
to act with us if we will let her, and Austria lies like a great
log, favouring Russia and opposing her inert mass to anything
like <i>mouvement</i>, no matter with what object or in
what quarter.</p>

<h2>1835.</h2>

<h3>January 1st, 1835</h3>

<p>Parliament dissolved at last, and all speculation
about the elections will soon be settled in certainty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
It is remarkable what confidence is expressed by both sides.
Three Tories stand for the City; but Ward told me they
rather expected to run their opponents hard than to come in,
but that such an exhibition of strength would be important,
as it will. The Duke of Wellington is so well aware of the
obstacle that he is to Stanley&rsquo;s joining the Government that
he wanted not to belong to it originally, and he is now
meditating his retreat, in order to open the way for Stanley.
It cannot be denied that he has acted very nobly throughout
this business, and upon nothing but a sense of duty, without
regard for himself. Some doubts have occurred to me of
the vast utility of Stanley, and his being so entirely without
a party proves that he is not held in very high estimation,
and though I should be glad to see a better set of names in
the various offices (which are for the most part miserably
filled) I should not altogether like to see the Duke of Wellington
retire out of deference to such men as the four who
would succeed him, and those who would have to retire with
him. I heard a ridiculous anecdote of the King the other
day. He wrote to the Duke about something&mdash;no matter
what, but I believe some appointment&mdash;and added <i>á propos
de bottes</i>, &lsquo;His Majesty begs to call the attention of the Duke
to the <i>theoretical</i> state of Persia.&rsquo; The Duke replied that he
was aware of the importance of Persia, but submitted that
it was a matter which did not <i>press</i> for the moment.</p>

<p>Yesterday I dined with Robarts, and after dinner he
gave me an account of the state of his borough (Maidstone),
and as it is a tolerably fair sample probably of the real condition
of the generality of boroughs, and of the principles
and disposition of their constituencies, I will put it down.
There are 1,200 voters; the Dissenters are very numerous
and of every imaginable sect and persuasion. He has been
member seventeen years; the place very corrupt. Formerly
(before the Reform Bill), when the constituency was less
numerous, the matter was easily and simply conducted; the
price of votes was as regularly fixed as the price of bread&mdash;so
much for a single vote and so much for a plumper, and this he
had to pay. After the Reform Bill he resolved to pay no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STATE OF THE CONSTITUENCIES.</span>
more money, as corruption was to cease. The consequence
was that during his canvass none of the people who had
formerly voted for him would promise him their votes. They
all sulked and hesitated, and, in short, waited to see what
would be offered them. I asked him what were the new
constituencies. &lsquo;If possible worse than the old.&rsquo; The people
are generally alive to public affairs&mdash;look into the votes and
speeches of members, give their opinions&mdash;but are universally
corrupt. They have a sour feeling against what are nicknamed
abuses, rail against <i>sinnicures</i>, as they call them, and
descant upon the enormity of such things while they are
forced to work all day long and their families have not
enough to eat. But the one prevailing object among the
whole community is to make money of their votes, and
though he says there are some exceptions, they are very few
indeed. Robarts too is a Reformer, and supports all Whig
and reforming Governments; but he does so (like many
others) from fear. What he most dreads is collision, and
most desires is quiet, and he thinks non-resistance the best
way. There is no reason to believe that other constituencies
materially differ from this; what therefore is the result?
Power has been transferred to a low class of persons; so low
as to be dissatisfied and malignant, high enough to be half-instructed;
so poor that money is an object to them, and
without any principle which should deter them from getting
it in any way they can: they may, on the whole, be considered
as disaffected towards existing institutions, for when they contrast
their own life of labour and privation with the wealth
and splendour which they see around them, there is little difficulty
in persuading them that they are grievously wronged,
and that the wrong is in the nature of the institutions themselves.
These general considerations make them therefore lean
towards those who promise better things, and strive to introduce
changes; but as their immediate wants are always
uppermost, their votes are generally at the disposal of the
highest bidder, whatever his politics may be.</p>

<h3>January 3rd, 1835</h3>

<p>They can find nobody to go to India.
Lord Ellenborough (by Peel&rsquo;s desire) wrote to the Duke and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
asked his advice, at the same time suggesting Sir James
Graham. The Duke replied that he thought it better not to
have anything to do with that party at present; that the best
man he knew would be Lord Heytesbury, if he would go, or
such a man as Lord Fitzroy Somerset, whom he mentioned,
not because he had been long known to him, and had served
under himself, but because he was a very able man, and the
best man of business he was acquainted with. Kemp refused
it; Ellenborough said that the more he looked into Indian
affairs, the more clearly he saw the urgency of sending a
Governor-General. Whether by this he means to imply
that Lord William Bentinck has done ill, I know not; but
he is always said to have done admirably well. In a letter
which the Duke wrote to the King, not long ago, he told
him that it was desirable to make as few changes in the
foreign policy of the Government as possible. Notwithstanding
the confidence of his underlings, and of the crowd
of fools and females who follow the camp, it is clear that the
Duke and Peel are both sensible of the danger of their
situation.</p>

<h3>January 4th, 1835</h3>

<p>There is every prospect of a miserable
defeat of the Conservatives in the City, which will be doubly
disastrous, first as to the election, which is an important one,
and secondly because it will go far to neutralise the effect of
the famous address they got up. This is owing to mismanagement.
The Committee has been bad and negligent;
then they did a very foolish thing in ousting Pattison from
Harwich to make room for Bonham; if they had left Pattison
alone (which Harris had, I believe, pledged himself should be
done), Lyall would have come in for the City, and perhaps
Ward too; but when the electioneering affairs are left to
William Peel, Ross, and Granville Somerset, no wonder there
is not much dexterity and finesse displayed. I have published
a pamphlet to help them; but as I never put my
name to my pamphlets, of course nobody reads them.</p>

<h3>January 5th, 1835</h3>

<p>Sebastiani is coming here as Ambassador&mdash;that
is, unless he changes his mind and pleads ill-health.
The French Government notified to us his appointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ST. AULAIRE AND PRINCESS METTERNICH.</span>
without asking our consent, and when the Duke stated it to
the Cabinet, objections were made; he accordingly wrote
the same day to Bacourt, stating that the Cabinet thought
the appointment objectionable, and that there would be
difficulties in transacting business with him. The French
Government expressed surprise, and rather insist upon their
appointment, and as ours does not think it worth while to
have a dispute about it, he is to come; but we think they
have behaved very ill, for the Duke never proposed the Paris
Embassy to Lord Cowley till he had communicated with
France, and ascertained that the nomination would be agreeable
to the King. It was expected that St. Aulaire or
Latour-Maubourg would have come here. It is of Madame
de St. Aulaire that Talleyrand said, &lsquo;Elle cherche l&rsquo;esprit que
son mari trouve.&rsquo; (This anecdote I suspect not to be true,
or not true of Madame de St. Aulaire, who is a very intelligent,
agreeable woman, more lively and with more <i>finesse
d&rsquo;esprit</i> than her husband.)</p>

<p>St. Aulaire is Ambassador at Vienna, and, however clever,
he either wants presence of mind or is touchy, as the following
anecdote shows. Madame de Metternich is a fine handsome
woman, ill brought up, impertinent, <i>insouciante</i>, and
<i>assez bourrue&mdash;au reste</i>, quick and amusing. She went to a
ball at St. Aulaire&rsquo;s with a fine coronet of diamonds on, and
when he came to receive her he said, &lsquo;Mon dieu, madame,
quelle belle couronne vous avez sur la tête!&rsquo; &lsquo;Au moins,&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;ce n&rsquo;est par une couronne que j&rsquo;ai volée.&rsquo; Instead
of turning it into a joke, he made a serious affair of it, and
went the next day to Metternich with a formal complaint;
but Metternich said, &lsquo;Mais mon cher, que voulez-vous? Vous
voyez que j&rsquo;ai épousé une femme sans éducation; je ne puis
pas l&rsquo;empêcher de dire de pareilles sottises, mais vous sentez
bien que ce serait fort inconvénant pour moi de m&rsquo;en mêler.
Allons! il n&rsquo;y faut plus penser,&rsquo; and so turned it off, and turned
him out, by insisting on making a joke of the affair, as St.
Aulaire had better have done at first.</p>

<h3>January 7th, 1835</h3>

<p>Just as might have been expected, the
Conservative candidates in the City are defeated by an enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
majority. Pattison, the Governor of the Bank, the
Liberal candidate who came in second on the poll, having
been proposed by Jones
Loyd,<a name="FNA_26_02" id="FNA_26_02"></a><a href="#FN_26_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
the richest banker in the
City, and perhaps the richest man in
Europe.<a name="FNA_26_03" id="FNA_26_03"></a><a href="#FN_26_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Such outward
demonstrations as these unquestionably afford a very plausible
answer to the opposite cry, and the victory on the Radical
side is great and important. Ward told me they should
at least run them hard, so that the disappointment must be
grievous; still it is asserted that the greatest part of the
wealth of the City will be found in the columns of the
address&mdash;but then the votes are in the other scale. The
elections, as far as they have gone, are rather against the
Government, but not showing any material difference in
numbers&mdash;sufficient, however, to prove that, in point of fact,
Peel&rsquo;s declarations have produced little or no effect, and
that the various considerations that have been urged on the
country and the appeals to its reason have been all alike
thrown away.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_26_02" id="FN_26_02"></a><a href="#FNA_26_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>

[The four City members were: Matthew Wood, James Pattison, William
Crawford, and George Grote.]</p></div>

<p>I saw a letter which Barnes wrote to Henry de Ros
yesterday, in which he speaks with horror and alarm of the
prevailing spirit. He says the people are deaf with passion,
and in the abrupt dissolution of the late Government and
the bad composition of this they <i>will</i> see a conspiracy against
their liberties, and mad and preposterous as the idea is,
there is no eradicating it from their brains. I am afraid
this is too true, and though no alarmist generally, and rather
sluggish of fear, I do begin to tremble; and while I cast my
eyes about in all directions to see what resource is in store
for us, I can find none that is anything like satisfactory;
the violence of party-spirit seems to blind everybody concerned
in politics to all contingent possibilities, and every
feeling of decency and propriety is forgotten.</p>

<p>Last night I was at Lady Holland&rsquo;s; there were Lord
and Lady Holland, Mulgrave, Seaford, Allen and Burdett.
I asked them if they had read Whittle Harvey&rsquo;s speech at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">VIOLENCE OF PARTY SPIRIT.</span>
Southwark, which was a tissue of the grossest and most
outrageous abuse and ridicule of the King and Queen.
They said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; so I read to them some of the most offensive
passages. Not the slightest disgust did they express.
Holland merely said to one allegation, &lsquo;<i>That</i> is not true,&rsquo;
and Mulgrave laughed, and said, &lsquo;Whittle is an <i>eccentric</i>
politician.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>January 8th, 1835</h3>

<p>On the whole the returns yesterday presented
a gain to Government of about 10 votes, many elections
turning out contrary to expectation both ways, and
some very severe contests. The City was a great defeat:
the lowest Whig beat the highest Tory by above 1,400.
It is remarkable that many who signed the address to the
King voted for the Radical candidates.</p>

<p>At dinner yesterday at Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s I met the
Chancellor, whom I have not seen for some time. After
dinner we talked about the state of affairs. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;will it do? what do you think?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to think, but on the whole I am disposed to think it
will <i>not</i> do. I don&rsquo;t see how you are to get on.&rsquo; &lsquo;What do
you think of Peel?&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;is he a fit man for the purpose?&rsquo;
&lsquo;He is a very able man, and prudent.&rsquo; &lsquo;Aye, but
is he enough of a man of the world? does he know enough
of what is going on in the world?&rsquo; To which I said, &lsquo;You
have just hit upon the point that I have been lamenting.
He has not lived in the world, and he has not about him
those who do, and who can give him that particular sort of
information and advice of which he stands in need; and I
think he has, in great measure owing to this, committed
a great blunder in forming such a Government as he has
done; he has not been able to throw off the old prejudices
of keeping to his party, and thought it necessary to depend
upon them, when he ought to have seen that the case was
one out of ordinary rules, that the support of the Tories
alone could not maintain him, and that, if they would not
give it him for their own interest, and in furtherance of
their own principles, without insisting upon being in office,
though he might not be able to get on without it, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
still less be able to get on with their support alone. In
his place I should have told them I could not take them in,
that if they would confide in me, and let me help the country
out of its difficulties in my own way, I would do the best I
could for it and for them.&rsquo; Lyndhurst said that &lsquo;he was not
much consulted;&rsquo; that if he had had the formation of the
Government he should have gone to work very differently;
that he would have had a small Cabinet, eight or ten at
most, composed of new men, leaving out Aberdeen, Goulburn,
Herries, and the rest of that description, employing them if
possible abroad, or if not, telling them that it was necessary
to lay them on the shelf for a time, and that he would do
what he could for them at a future period; that Ellenborough
had told Peel he had much better not take him into the Government;
that he was aware he was not popular, and though
he might be of some use with regard to details of business, his
support out of office would (he thought), on the whole, be
more serviceable than his being in the Cabinet. Peel said
that his willingness to sacrifice himself only made it more
incumbent on him not to permit him to do so, and insisted
upon having him. Lyndhurst said he had hoped that Sandon
would have been taken, and he had suggested Lord
Carnarvon, to which Peel replied that he was still so young
that he thought he might be passed over for the present
I said, &lsquo;Why it is the present for which it is necessary to
provide, and it is <i>now</i> that he might have been made available.&rsquo;
(Carnarvon would not join on account of ill-health.)
We then talked over what sort of a Cabinet might have
been got together, of new names, moderate men, few in
number. He admitted that a great mistake had been committed,
and that, as it was irreparable, so it would very probably
be fatal. He praised the Duke of Wellington. I said
I would not have taken him in, or have got him to go to
Ireland, for he was ready to do anything to advance the
cause. He liked this idea very much. I reminded him that
the first day we had talked over the matter he had admitted
that it would never do to bolster up the old concern again,
and that Hardinge had told me the Tories were all ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE MOVEMENT AT HOLLAND HOUSE.</span>
make any sacrifices or postpone their claims, so that such a
course as we suggested need not have been difficult. I told
him of Barnes&rsquo;s letter, and of his fears, and what he said of
the effect produced by the composition of the Government.
He said the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; had behaved admirably to them, and
the Government were under great obligations to me for what
I had done in that matter. I told him I was glad to hear
they were on such good terms, as having been instrumental
to the connection, which I had no doubt had entailed an
immediate loss on the proprietors of the paper.</p>

<p>He asked me if I thought the Opposition meant to refuse
the Supplies. I said I had no doubt they did. &lsquo;Then we
must go.&rsquo; But he still expects they will have 300 votes in
the House of Commons, and with that he calculates that
they may struggle on with one-half of the House of Commons,
the House of Lords, the King, and a large proportion of the
wealth and respectability of the country. It would be difficult,
but he thought they might get on; but that the fact
was, there was <i>no going on</i> after the transfer of power to
another class, which the Reform Bill had effected. I said
there was no doubt of that, and that the Reform Bill had
produced virtually a complete revolution in this country.
&lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;much more than that of &rsquo;88.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>January 9th, 1835</h3>

<p>Dined at Holland House; they are satisfied
with the elections. Mulgrave said that, out of the present return,
they had to add thirty to their list and to deduct thirteen
of their original calculations, giving them seventeen more
than they expected. There is a small gain to the Tories, but
nothing like enough. It cannot do; all the moderate Whigs
(for it is not a question of Tories) are beaten in the metropolitan
districts. Spankie&rsquo;s admirable addresses have ensured
his defeat. Duncombe, immediately after an exposure of
the most disgraceful kind, will be returned by a majority
doubling that of any of the other candidates; and it is not a
little remarkable that Duncombe is supported by all the
Dissenters, even the Quakers, with whom austerity of
morals and a decent behaviour are supposed to have weight&mdash;but
the rabid spirit of disaffection to government and rule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
bears down every other consideration, and these &lsquo;enlightened
electors&rsquo; (as their flatterers always call them) are frantic
with passion against everything belonging to what they call
&lsquo;the aristocracy&rsquo; of the country. But who can wonder at
these people, when we see the great Whig Lords smiling
complacently at their brutal violence and senseless rage?
At Holland House they talk in the same strain; not that they
utter any indecent language, but they are passionate for the
success of the movement. One single object have they&mdash;to
eject Peel and the Tory Government; they own they don&rsquo;t
know what is to follow; they do not deny that the movement
must be accelerated, but they don&rsquo;t care; they say the
Duke is responsible, for he ought not to have accepted the
King&rsquo;s commission, and then Melbourne must have been
sent for again the next day. Now <i>they</i> must take the consequences&mdash;that
is, the King and the Tories. They said last
night that by the old Government the movement might
have been checked; by any that can be formed on the downfall
of the new it cannot&mdash;or at least that it must go farther
than it would have done. I asked, &lsquo;Then is there anything
you think worse than advancing the movement?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
cried out Lord Holland, &lsquo;making the movement stand
still.&rsquo; &lsquo;And do you mean that you believe there is any
danger of that, and that the movement (the progress of
improvement) ever can stand still?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I do believe it,&rsquo;
&amp;c.... Such a miserable apology for their insane violence
puts argument and reasoning out of the question; they are
resolved to fight for power, &lsquo;to let slip the dogs of war,&rsquo;
ignorant whither they will go, and careless what shall be
their prey.</p>

<h3>January 10th, 1835</h3>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable in these elections
than the confidence of both parties in the result, and
the difference of their statements as to actual numbers, Bonham,
who is now, <i>faute de mieux</i>, the man-of-all-work of the
Tories, told me last night that they had an actual majority
on the returns of about twenty, whereas I went through the
list, and after detecting some errors, made out that there is
a majority of about thirty the other way. The Whig language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONTEST AT ROCHESTER.</span>
is still the same always, and everywhere&mdash;that they do
not see what is to happen when this Government is out;
that no daylight appears, but still that out it shall go. They
own that they must (if they return to power) do a great
deal more than they would otherwise have done, but that
while they obey that necessity, they make it easy to their
consciences, because it is the other party which has imposed
it upon them.</p>

<h3>January 11th, 1835</h3>

<p>The Government people still declare their
satisfaction at the result of the elections, and make out that
the numbers are tolerably even. The contests are curious
from their closeness. Charles Wellesley lost at Rochester
by one, Lushington by four. There is a great number of
similar cases; in that of Rochester it is more remarkable
from the accident by which the election was lost. There
were two ships in quarantine, one of which had one voter
on board and the other two; they had both sailed the same
day from the port they left, but one had been longer on the
voyage. The ship with one voter had a right to be released
on the 9th, the last day of the election, the other not till
three days later. As the circumstances were the same. Sir
J. Marshall, the Superintendent, suggested that both
might be released together, but I did not dare relax the
severity of the
restriction.<a name="FNA_26_04" id="FNA_26_04"></a><a href="#FN_26_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Rosslyn was rather for doing it,
but I persuaded him it would be dangerous, as, if the election
should turn upon it, we should never hear the last of it,
especially the Duke, to whose charge it would be laid; and
the election <i>actually turned on those two votes</i>. The best
chance that I see is, that when the hour of struggle arrives
there may be more moderate men than the Whig leaders are
aware of&mdash;more who, without supporting, still less joining,
the new Government, will abstain from taking a violent part
against them. This is my only hope, for as to a majority,
I have not the slightest expectation of any such thing, and
am at a loss to conceive on what they count.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_26_04" id="FN_26_04"></a><a href="#FNA_26_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[The administration of the Quarantine Regulations is vested in the
Privy Council, and exercised by the Clerk of the Council]</p></div>

<h3>January 12th, 1835</h3>

<p>Up to the latest returns the Tories make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
out that they have a majority, or at least an equality;
the Whigs, that they have a majority of about seventy.
The latter calculation is nearer to the truth, and it only
remains to be seen how many of their people will refuse
to support extreme measures. Last night at Holland
House Mulgrave was perfectly furious with Charles Fox for
saying he would not oppose Manners Sutton being put in
the chair. It has been asserted all along by some of the
opposite party that Peel&rsquo;s measures have been influenced
(especially in the composition of his Government) by a desire
to keep the Tories together, and prepare a strong Opposition.
I suspect there is some truth in this, for I can account in no
other way for the strange appointments he makes, and the
undiluted Toryism of his Government. He goes on the old
aristocratic principle of taking high birth and connection as
substitutes for other qualifications, and he never seems to
consider the former avowed sentiments of any man in weighing
his fitness for office. He has just made Sydney Herbert
Secretary to the Board of Control, an office of great labour
and involving considerable business in the House of
Commons.<a name="FNA_26_05" id="FNA_26_05"></a><a href="#FN_26_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
He is about twenty-two or twenty three years old, unpractised
in business, and never spoke but once in the House of
Commons, when he made one of those pretty first speeches
which prove little or nothing, and that was in opposition to
the Dissenters. He may be very fit for this place, but it
remains to be proved, and I am surprised he did not make
him begin with a Lordship of the Treasury or some such
thing, and put Gladstone, who is a very clever man, in that
post. Praed is First Secretary to the Board of Control, and
will do the business.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_26_05" id="FN_26_05"></a><a href="#FNA_26_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[The injustice of this remark has since become very obvious, for no
man was better qualified to enter upon official life, or to run a great career
in it, than Sydney Herbert. It must also be said of Sir Robert Peel that he
was ever on the watch for the young and rising statesmen who, he said,
were hereafter to govern the country; and a very large proportion of the
men who have since played a most conspicuous and useful part were introduced
by Sir Robert Peel to public life&mdash;Sydney Herbert, the Duke of
Newcastle, Mr. Gladstone, Lord Cardwell, and others.]</p></div>

<p>I very much incline to believe that, although Peel says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR JOHN HOBHOUSE&rsquo;S VIEW OF AFFAIRS.</span>
he is satisfied with the returns, he does not expect the thing
will last, and that upon this conviction he is determined to
secure a retreat with such a force as shall make him formidable
hereafter. Such as the appointments are at home,
so are they abroad: Londonderry to St. Petersburg, Stuart to
Vienna, and in all probability Strangford to Constantinople&mdash;the
three men who are considered the great upholders of the
Anti-Liberal system. (Stuart told everybody he had the offer,
but it was not true.)</p>

<p>The Duke of Leuchtenberg arrived last night. The
picture of the young Queen of Portugal (which is probably
flattered) does not make her very tempting.</p>

<h3>January 15th, 1835</h3>

<p>The day before yesterday I fell in with
Hobhouse, and we walked together for some time. He said
he could not understand what the Government people meant
by claiming a majority, as he heard they did; that on the
Borough returns the Opposition had a majority of 100 more
or less, but that the difference could only be accounted for
by one party including all those who call themselves Whigs,
and who supported the late Government, and by the other
party counting those who, though not supporters, would be
disposed to give them a trial. He wondered at and blamed the
constitution of the Government, ridiculed the idea of Stanley
succeeding Peel, acknowledged that he saw no possibility of
any other Government being formed on the dissolution of
this, and had no conception what would happen&mdash;that another
dissolution would be indispensable. I said that I did not see
any more than he did what they were to do when they had
got Peel out; that their junction with the Radicals must end
there, unless (which I could not believe) they meant to come
into office on the principle of supporting and carrying all
the measures they had opposed last year. He said, &lsquo;I for one
will go no farther than I did then; no, that is out of the
question.&rsquo; He said the restoration of Melbourne&rsquo;s Government
was impossible after what had passed; they could not look the
King in the face again, nor he them, after such a clear intimation
on his part that he disliked them, and dreaded their principles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Soon after, however, he said that any other Government
must be formed on a more popular principle, and
especially must make the <i>arrangement</i> of the House of Lords
a condition, for it was impossible to go on as things were,
between the two houses; that it might have been discovered
when the Reform Bill was proposed that this would be the
inevitable consequence of passing that measure, but that all
this he did not expect to be accomplished without a violent
collision, which would very likely lead to a republic; that he
should be sorry for the disturbance, but was prepared for it,
and if a sacrifice was to be made, he could not hesitate in
choosing the object of it.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I met Duncannon, and talked it all
over. I asked him if he saw any chance of forming a Government,
and if he figured to himself what the King would
do. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;he will send for Stanley.&rsquo; &lsquo;What
next?&rsquo; &lsquo;He may send for Lord Grey.&rsquo; &lsquo;Will Lord Grey
propose such measures as you think indispensable?&rsquo; &lsquo;If
he will not return, or won&rsquo;t go the length, he may send for
Melbourne again; but it is clear he&mdash;the King&mdash;must be
prepared for a more Radical Government.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
think he will ever consent to take such a one, or to agree
to the measures they will propose to him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, but he
must, he can&rsquo;t help himself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, but my belief is that,
happen what may, he will not.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t think
he will abdicate?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I do, rather than agree to certain
things.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, but then he must abdicate.&rsquo; Such
is the language of the leaders of the other party, and so
calmly do they contemplate the possibility of such a consummation.
The point on which all this turns is evidently
the destruction of the House of Lords. The Whigs find it
necessary to finish the work they began, and to destroy the
last bulwark of Conservative power. Stanley&rsquo;s speech at his
election, which was very able and eloquent, has evidently
disappointed them. They had cherished a hope that he
would unite with them at last, which they now find he will
not do. There has been a great debate in their camp whether
they shall attack the Speaker or not, but it seems fixed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE COUNTY ELECTIONS.</span>
they shall, and probably they will be beaten. I am glad they
do this.</p>

<p>Theodore Hook, whom I met at dinner the other day,
and who is an <i>âme damnée</i> of the Speaker&rsquo;s, said that he
was ready to give up the chair if it was thought imprudent
to fight for it; he also said (which I don&rsquo;t believe) that the
Home Office had been offered him, and that he had declined
it because he could not quit the chair without a peerage,
and that he should be of more use in it than in the House of
Lords.</p>

<p>Theodore Hook <i>improvised</i> in a wonderful way that
evening; he sang a song, the burthen of which was &lsquo;Good
Night,&rsquo; inimitably good, and which might have been written
down. I heard two good things at dinner yesterday, one of
Spankie&rsquo;s. In his canvass he met with a refusal from some
tradesman, who told him he should vote for Duncombe and
Wakley. Spankie said, &lsquo;Well, my friend, I am sorry you
won&rsquo;t vote for me, and I can only say that I hope you may
have Tom Duncombe for your customer, and Wakley for your
tenant.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_26_06" id="FNA_26_06"></a><a href="#FN_26_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The other is attributed to Alvanley. Some
reformer was clamouring for the expulsion of the Bishops
from the House of Lords, but said he would not have them
all go; he would leave two: &lsquo;To keep up the breed, I suppose,&rsquo;
said the other.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_26_06" id="FN_26_06"></a><a href="#FNA_26_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[The one was celebrated for non-payment of his bills, and the other
was suspected of setting fire to his house. Wakley&rsquo;s house was burnt, and
he brought an action against the Insurance Office, which declined to pay
his policy. I forget what was the result of the trial, but that of the
evidence was a conviction of his own instrumentality.]</p></div>

<h3>January 17th, 1835</h3>

<p>The Middlesex election terminated in the
return of Hume by about 400 votes&mdash;Wood got a majority
of about 250 at first, but could not sustain it. It would
have been a capital thing to turn out Hume, but I never
expected it.</p>

<h3>January 20th, 1835</h3>

<p>Sir George Murray is beaten at Perth;
James Wortley at Forfar&mdash;blows to the Government. On
the other hand, Palmerston is beaten in Hants, at which
everybody rejoices, for he is marvellously unpopular; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
would have liked to illuminate the Foreign Office. Lord
Harrowby called on me yesterday; he told me my pamphlet
had been attributed to Croker in some company where he
had been. Jonathan Peel told me yesterday morning that
Lady Alice Kennedy had sent word to his wife that the
Queen is with child; if it be true, and a queer thing if it is,
it will hardly come to anything at her age, and with her
health; but what a difference it would make!</p>

<h3>January 23rd, 1834</h3>

<p>Within the last few days the county
elections have given a considerable turn to the state of
affairs. The Conservatives have been everywhere triumphant.
Norfolk, Derbyshire, Hants, Lancashire&mdash;two Whigs
turned out and two Conservatives returned; Ingilby in
Lincolnshire; one in Surrey, one in Kent: and if these affairs
had not been infamously managed, they would have returned
two in Surrey, two in Kent, and (if they had put up a better
man) one in the other division of Norfolk. The great and
most important victory, however, is Francis Egerton in
Lancashire, who is nearly 1,000 above his opponents, and
has been received with astonishing enthusiasm, and was the
popular candidate, even at Manchester and with the mob.
These elections have damped the spirits of the Radicals, and
proportionally raised those of the Government. The &lsquo;Morning
Chronicle&rsquo; was yesterday quite silent on the subject, and at
Holland House, where I dined, they were evidently in no
small disgust. I told Lord Holland that I considered the
Lancashire election as the most important event that had occurred,
and one calculated to have a great moral effect in
favour of the Government, which he owned was true, and they
did not deny that the Government had cause for elation.</p>

<p>In the morning we had a meeting at the Council Office to
consider of the removal of assizes, when Lyndhurst in his off-hand
way said to me, &lsquo;Well, I think we are safe now; I have
no fears.&rsquo; &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but I have.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh no, we
are on a rock&mdash;adamant.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think they are yet in a
condition to begin triumphing, but I certainly see daylight,
which I did not before. Nobody can possibly deny that
there is a great reaction in the country; and though the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHURCH REFORM BILL.</span>
weight of the towns, and the power of the ten-pounders
thrown into the other scale, make it preponderate, there is
a strong counteracting force which will enable the better
cause to maintain a respectable fight. I expect that Francis
Egerton&rsquo;s election will produce indirectly very important
consequences, and will be the means of proving to moderate,
doubting, timorous politicians that they need not shrink
from avowing whatever Conservative sentiments they really
do entertain. Much remains to be done, many difficulties to
be surmounted, before anything like security can be felt, but
undoubtedly the political horizon looks much brighter than
it did.</p>

<h3>January 25th, 1835</h3>

<p>A ridiculous thing happened the other
day. The Speaker came to the Council Office in a great
stew about the attacks on him, and wanted to look at the
register of the names of those who had attended at the
different Councils. Though I think he is a <i>pauvre sire</i>, he
has a very tolerable case here, and I wrote a letter to the
&lsquo;Times&rsquo; in his defence, and signed it &lsquo;Onslow,&rsquo; happening to
think of Speaker Onslow. The next day appeared a letter
from <i>Lord Onslow</i>, declaring that he was not the author of a
letter which had appeared in his name. The &lsquo;Times&rsquo; published
it, adding they thought he could hardly be serious.
Munster told me the day before yesterday that he was told
of the Queen&rsquo;s being with child on the day of the Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s dinner; that she is now between two and three
months gone. Of course there will be plenty of scandal.
Alvanley proposes that the psalm &lsquo;Lord, <i>how</i> wonderful are
thy works&rsquo; should be sung. It so happens, however, that
Howe has not been with the Court for a considerable time.</p>

<h3>January 27th, 1835</h3>

<p>There is a Committee sitting at my office
to arrange the Church Bill&mdash;Rosslyn, Wharncliffe, Ellenborough,
and Herries. It is generally believed they mean
to bring forward some very extensive measures. Allen says,
&lsquo;The honest Whigs cannot oppose it with honour, nor the
Tories support it without infamy,&rsquo; that all the honest Whigs
would support it, the honest Tories oppose it, the dishonest
Tories would support, and the dishonest Whigs oppose it. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
told me an anecdote at the same time which shows what the
supineness and sense of security of the Church were twenty
years ago. An architect built a chapel on Lord Holland&rsquo;s
land, near Holland House, and wished it to be appropriated
to the service of the Church of England, and served by a
curate. The rector objected and refused his consent. There
was no remedy against him, and all that could be done
was to make it a Methodist meeting-house, or a Roman
Catholic chapel, either of which by taking out a licence, the
builder could do. However, he got Lord Holland to speak
to the Archbishop of Canterbury (Sutton), to tell him the
difficulty, and request his interference with the rector to
suffer this chapel to be opened to an Orthodox congregation.
After some delay the Archbishop told Holland that he had
better advise his friend to take out a licence, and make it a
Catholic or Dissenting chapel, as he thought best. The
builder could not afford to lose the capital he had expended,
and acted upon the advice of the Primate. The chapel
is a meeting-house to this day. I shall be very glad
if this reform of the Church is well done and gives satisfaction,
and I do not know that any of the present Ministers
are pledged against a measure which improves the discipline
without diminishing the revenues of the Church, but certainly
reforms, and especially ecclesiastical reforms, do come with a
bad grace from them. It is ludicrous to see the &lsquo;Standard&rsquo;
writing Church reform articles; and the other day I looked
back at Knatchbull&rsquo;s speech at the Kentish meeting, a week
after the dissolution of the late Government, in which he
expressed an earnest hope that he might leave this country
&lsquo;without <i>any change</i> in <i>Church</i> or <i>State</i>.&rsquo; He has been Anti-everything
during his whole life, and now he is come into
office to carry into effect &lsquo;safe and necessary reforms,&rsquo; which
he never could perceive the slightest occasion for while he
was out. All these things are disgusting; they disgust one
with political life, they lower the characters of public men.
One strains one&rsquo;s eyes in vain to catch a sight of sincerity,
straightforwardness, disinterestedness, consistency; each
party we have constantly acting with a view to its own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">INSECURITY OF THE TORIES.</span>
interests <i>as a party</i>, and always disregarding consequences
with miserable shortsightedness.</p>

<h3>February 2nd, 1835</h3>

<p>The elections are over, and still each side
claims a majority. It will turn out probably that the
Government have about 270 thick and thin men. Since the
Lancashire election, the Whigs have certainly not been so
elated, though they still expect to succeed. They begin with
the Speakership, and put up Abercromby, who is probably
the best candidate they could select; he is a dull, grave man,
sensible and hard-headed I fancy, but it has always been
matter of astonishment to me that they should make so
much of him as they do. The Duke of Wellington is constantly
regretting that he did not abstain from taking office,
as he wished to do, and I hear that Peel now thinks it would
have been better: but he thinks so because he fancies that
Stanley would have joined if the Duke had not been there,
which is after all very doubtful. Stanley has preserved the
strictest neutrality through the late contest, and been very
guarded and cautious in his language&mdash;so much so, that the
Whigs think he will vote for Abercromby against Manners
Sutton, which I don&rsquo;t believe. The Church Reform is in
active preparation; I know nothing of its details.</p>

<p>Pozzo di Borgo is coming here, and the Emperor sends
him partly to save time and, Madame de Lieven writes me
word, &lsquo;to prove his goodwill, by sending his ablest and most
confidential diplomatist.&rsquo; Old Talleyrand would very likely
have been glad enough to come back too (while the Duke is
in office), but he is gone to Richecote. A great mystery is
still made about the Queen&rsquo;s <i>grossesse</i>; the medical men believe
it, though they think it no certainty.</p>

<h3>February 8th, 1834</h3>

<p>On Monday last we had the Sheriffs&rsquo;
dinner at Lord
Rosslyn&rsquo;s,<a name="FNA_26_07" id="FNA_26_07"></a><a href="#FN_26_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
where I met for the first time all
the new men. Murray did not come, for since his defeat in
Perthshire he no longer considers himself of the Cabinet.
Before dinner Peel told me he had offered the vacant Lordship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of the Treasury to Charles
Canning,<a name="FNA_26_08" id="FNA_26_08"></a><a href="#FN_26_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
in a letter to Lady
Canning, saying it would give him great pleasure to introduce
her son into public life, and that he should be glad to
treat him with confidence, and do all that lay in him to promote
his success. Lady Canning wrote a very gracious
answer, saying that she preferred his being in Parliament
some time before he took office, but neither he nor she was
indisposed to support him and his Government. At this
dinner the Duke talked to me about Spain, and said that the
affair at the Post Office at Madrid, in which Canterac was
killed, was the most lamentable thing that had happened,
and the most discreditable to the Government; that if the
Carlists did not rise upon it all over Spain, it was clear there
were none; that it was a most extraordinary war, in which
the Carlists had the superiority in the field, but possessed no
fortified and even no open town; and that, notwithstanding
all the plunder and devastation incidental to such a state of
things, all the farmers in the disturbed provinces regularly
paid their rents.</p>

<p>Sandon is to move the address in the House of Commons,
Lord Carnarvon refused to move it in the House of Lords.
I think the Church Reform Commission, which was gazetted
a few days ago, has done good, especially as it is backed up
by Peel&rsquo;s refusing to fill up the vacant Prebendary of Westminster,
and placing it at the disposal of the Commissioners.</p>

<p>I went to Oatlands on Wednesday for two nights, and
met the Duchess, Countess, the Granvilles, and Pahlen. It
was agreeable enough. Lord Granville told us a curious
story of an atrocity very recently committed in France.
The governor of a military academy had objected to one of
the officers, a professor, bringing a woman who lived with
him into the establishment. The man persisted, and he
finally ordered her to be ejected. Resolving to be revenged,
the officer took these means; he bribed a servant of
the governor&rsquo;s, who let him into the house at night; when
he got into the bedroom of his daughter, ravished her, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S WHIMS.</span>
then wounded her severely with some sharp instrument, but
not mortally. The girl is still alive, but in a state of frenzy;
the case is coming before the French tribunals. [This was
the famous case of La Roncière, very inaccurately stated
above. There is now little doubt that La Roncière was innocent,
and that the story was got up by the girl to revenge
herself on him for some slight.]</p>

<p>My brothers tell me that the Duke is bored to death with
the King, who thinks it necessary to be giving advice and
opinions upon different matters, always to the last degree
ridiculous and absurd. He is just now mightily indignant at
Lord Napier&rsquo;s affair at Canton, and wants to go to war with
China. He writes in this strain to the Duke, who is obliged
to write long answers, very respectfully telling him what an
old fool he is. Another crotchet of his is to buy the Island
of St. Bartholomew (which belongs to Denmark, and which
the Danes want to sell) for fear the Russians should buy it,
as he is very jealous of Russia. The Duke told him that it
would cost 70,000&#8467;. or 80,000&#8467;., for which they must go to
Parliament; and he did not think any House of Commons
we were likely to have would vote such a sum for such a
purpose. Then he does not at all like Pozzo di Borgo&rsquo;s
coming here, and wrote to say that since he was to come, it
was well that he would have the vigilant eye of the Duke to
watch him, for he never could look upon him in any other
light than as the servile tool of advancing the ambitious objects
of an aggrandising and unprincipled Power, or words
to that effect. He thinks his present Ministers do not treat
him well, inasmuch as they do not tell him enough. The
last, it seems, constantly fed him with scraps of information
which he twaddled over, and probably talked nonsense about;
but it is difficult to imagine anything more irksome for a
Government beset with difficulties like this than to have to
discuss the various details of their measures with a silly
bustling old fellow, who can by no possibility comprehend
the scope and bearing of anything.</p>

<h3>February 14th, 1835</h3>

<p>There has been a wonderful lull for some
time past, and though we are said to be, and I believe we in
fact are, on the eve of a crisis of great importance, perfect
tranquillity prevails universally (except, of course, in Ireland),
and men go about their daily occupations without any signs
of apprehension. The state of this country is a curious
political paradox; however, speculation will soon be lost in
certainty, so it is of no use thinking more of the matter. The
newspapers have been filled <i>usque ad nauseam</i> with the debates
about the Speakership, and both parties are equally
confident, but the bets are in favour of Sutton. The argument
on his side has been triumphant, and the Abercrombians
have not urged the best that they might. Tom Duncombe,
who at first said he would vote for Sutton, and now votes
the other way, puts it on the true ground, &lsquo;that it is a good
factious vote.&rsquo; I have little doubt that Peel will come down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">OPENING OF THE SESSION.</span>
in Parliament with a fair and reasonable case, but I have no
hope that he will propose or agree to anything satisfactorily
about the Irish Church; and if anything overturns his
Government, it will be that unhappy question of appropriation.
From George Dawson&rsquo;s language, whom I fell in with
the other morning, I see they are resolved to stand like rocks
in defending &lsquo;the Church,&rsquo; as they call it. All this week
and the last I have been at my office the whole day with our
Judicial Committee, which works very well. We have
Shadwell, Parke, Bosanquet and Erskine continually; and
Vaughan, Nicholl and Jenner occasionally. Alava talked
to me about the Duke of Wellington, of whom he said everybody
was afraid, even his nearest relations, and that he found
him, &lsquo;très changé pour lui.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>February 15th, 1835</h3>

<p>Dined at Miss Berry&rsquo;s, and Lord John
Russell came after; told me he had 320 people to vote with
him on the Speakership (of whom perhaps 20 will not come),
so his party make sure of it. Nobody talks of anything else,
and what has been written on the subject in pamphlets and
newspapers would fill volumes. Though it is become inconceivably
tiresome, I cannot help writing and talking about
it myself, so impossible is it to avoid the contagion. I went
yesterday to see the two Houses of
Parliament;<a name="FNA_27_01" id="FNA_27_01"></a><a href="#FN_27_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the old
House of Lords (now House of Commons) is very spacious
and convenient; but the present House of Lords is a wretched
dog-hole. The Lords will be very sulky in such a place, and
in a great hurry to get back to their own House, or to have
another. For the first time there is a gallery in the House
of Commons reserved for reporters, which is quite inconsistent
with their standing orders, and the prohibition which
still in form exists against publishing the debates. It is a
sort of public and avowed homage to opinion, and a recognition
of the right of the people to know through the medium
of the press all that passes within those walls.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_27_01" id="FN_27_01"></a><a href="#FNA_27_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[The old Houses of Parliament were burnt down on October 16, 1834,
during Mr. Greville&rsquo;s absence from town in the autumn. The Houses here
spoken of were the temporary buildings used during the erection of the new
Houses.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Lord John said to me, &lsquo;Do you remember last year, when
we were talking, I told you I thought the House of Lords
would throw out some measure or other&mdash;that there would
be a change of Government, a dissolution; and then we
should have a Parliament returned with which <i>nobody</i> could
govern the country? You see we have reached that point.&rsquo;
According to their several calculations, both the opposite
parties continue to claim a majority, or rather on the Tory
side an equality; and as these are made by men experienced
in the composition of the House, and as almost everybody is
pledged and committed in some way or other, it is a perfect
enigma to me how one or the other can be so deceived. The
Whigs, having discovered that Abercromby must be proposed
&lsquo;upon a great principle&rsquo; (which is great as <i>omne ignotum</i> is
<i>magnificum</i>&mdash;for they have never given a hint of what the
principle is), have now found out that the English Church
Reform which is in agitation is a very bad move on the part
of the Government, as <i>the people</i> do not care about Church
Reform here&mdash;do not want any such thing. This is, very
possibly, in great measure true; for <i>the people</i>, who are urged
and excited by the Radical leaders, will be sure to grow
indifferent about such reforms as they can obtain by legitimate
means, and with the concurrence of legitimate authority,
and be invited to agitate for those which may be more
difficult or slow of accomplishment. Sydney Smith said last
night that he hears from those who know that it will be very
sweeping; but he thinks it will not touch the great livings,
nor meddle with advowsons. He concludes that at the same
time the Dissenters will be relieved from Church rates, that
tithes will be extinguished, and the question of Dissenters&rsquo;
marriages settled. This has been an enormous scandal, and
its continuance has been owing to the pride, obstinacy, and
avarice of the Church; they would not give up the fees they
received from this source, and they were satisfied to celebrate
these rites in church while the parties were from the beginning
to the end of the service protesting against all and
every part of it, often making a most indecent noise and
interruption. All these grievous abuses must be done away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHURCH REFORM.</span>
with; and deeply responsible are those who never would
hear of their being done away with before. These guilty
parties are the clergy and the Tories, both of whom, now that
it is almost too late, have consented to drop their arrogant
pretensions, and to submit to those necessary and reasonable
reforms against which they have so bitterly inveighed, and
so resolutely fought. We are disgusted and shocked at
reading Croly&rsquo;s account of the scandalous conduct of the
Catholic clergy in Ireland, with regard to the emoluments
they extort from their miserable flocks, and at the systematic
desecration of holy things which they countenance and
practise; but when the difference is considered between
their spiritual condition and their moral composition as a
class, the conduct of the clergy here appears just as revolting.
The Irish clergy are generally sprung from the lowest
class, and have received a bad education at Maynooth; they
depend for subsistence upon the voluntary liberality or devotion
of their people, they have few motives or principles of
restraint, and every incentive to follow the shameful course
which they do; but the English clergy are generally respectably
born, well educated, and amply endowed, and yet they
are content to be the ministers of a scandalous system,
which, if it were not a source of profit to themselves, they
would not tolerate for an instant. Instead of compelling the
Dissenters to be married in church, if they had been really
penetrated with any devotional feelings, or by any considerations
of delicacy and charity, they would long ago have complained
of this necessity as a grievance, and besieged the
Legislature with entreaties to relieve the Church from the
scandal, and themselves from so painful and odious a duty.
But it was a badge of inferiority and dependence forced upon
the Dissenters, and a source of profit to themselves; and
therefore they defended and maintained it, and this is what
they call defending the Church; and when the Dissenters
themselves pray to be relieved from the tax and the humiliation,
and liberal men support their prayer, a cry is got up
that the Church is in danger. When the Dissenters,
having prayed in vain, grow louder and bolder in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
demands, and the cries of the Churchmen gradually sink into
a whine, which is at last silenced in submission, the Church
really is in danger; and then, when it no longer can be refused,
it becomes perilous to grant the boon which justice
and wisdom have so long required. So it is, and has been
with all obstinate and senseless denials, followed by reluctant
and tardy concessions&mdash;with Catholic emancipation, the Test
and Corporation Acts, Parliamentary Reform, and with
everything else; and thus, one of the great difficulties which
beset Peel and his Government is, that they stand in an
utterly false position. As a statesman, it must be mortifying
to him to reflect that all the great measures which his
political life has been spent in opposing have been carried in
spite of him, and that whatever danger may have resulted
from this cause is in great measure owing to the opposition
he was enabled, by his great talents and his influence, or
rather the influence of the party which he led, to give to
those measures. He contrived totally to fail in preventing
the success of the measures themselves, but so to mar and
delay them as to obviate the good that might have been
produced by timely and voluntary concessions; and now,
coming forward as he says, &lsquo;to resist the pressure from without,&rsquo;
he finds himself compelled to yield to that pressure;
for what, after all, is the language which he now holds, what
are his addresses, his speeches, his promises, his Church
Commission, but a surrender to the spirit and the principle
of Reform, and to the demands of the people&mdash;<i>the people</i>, as
contra-distinguished from those great interests on whose
support he has depended, and whose wishes or prejudices he
has consulted? For assuredly, neither the King, nor the
Church, nor the aristocracy, seriously and sincerely desire
these or any other reforms, and only agree to them from
necessity. Peel is, I think, right; he has no other alternative.
Such is the force and power of public opinion, that no
Government can resist it; and if Peel can succeed in restraining
and directing it, if he can convert it from a destructive
into a conservative element, he will render such a great service
as will cancel all the former mischief he has done; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FALSE POSITION OF SIR R. PEEL.</span>
enters with disadvantage upon a course which implies at the
outset the surrender of much of the governing principle of
his political life, and in which neither friend nor foe can
doubt that the conduct he adopts, however justifiable, necessary,
indispensable, is compulsory and unpalatable. A man
who is called to the head of affairs must undoubtedly act,
not according to any impracticable obstinate theories of his
own, but according to the state in which he finds affairs, no
matter how produced or by whom; but it is a very different
thing to adopt a system reluctantly and under necessity,
because somebody else by his incapacity or his misfortune
has rendered it indispensable, and to do so after you yourself
have brought about this state of things: and such is the
false position of Peel with all his Tory associates. This,
however, is begging the question in dispute between the two
great antagonistic parties. Peel would say that the imprudent
concessions and reckless changes of the Whigs have made
the difficulty; the Whigs would say that the resistance of
the Tories to all moderate and gradual reforms produced the
sweeping measure of &rsquo;31, and the excitement that was partly
its cause and partly its consequence.</p>

<h3>February 17th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday I read Burke&rsquo;s appeal from
the new to the old Whigs, which contains astonishing coincidences
with the present times. His definition of the
people is somewhat tumid and obscure, and involved in a
splendid confusion of generalities and abstruse doctrine; but
it is a wonderful monument of his genius, and exhibits that
extent of knowledge and accuracy of insight into the nature
of parties and the workings of political ambition which make
him an authority for all times, and show him to be in the
political what Shakespeare was in the moral world. But his
writings, however as objects of study they may influence
the opinions or form the judgment of young men, would
have no more power than a piece of musty parchment to
arrest the tide of present violence, and superinduce reflection
and calmness. A speech of Tom Duncombe&rsquo;s would produce
far greater effect than the perusal of a discourse of Burke&rsquo;s.
Wisdom never operates directly on masses; it may work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
upon them through secondary and by indirect means, but it
cannot face the noise of actual contest, where passion and
not reason is always uppermost. Nobody but Burke could
have described so well the Dukes of Devonshire and Bedford
of the present day, who appear to have lost their senses, and
to be ready to peril all their great possessions to gratify the
passions of the moment. He says:&mdash;&lsquo;But riches do not in
all cases secure even an inert and passive resistance; there
are always in that description men whose fortunes, when
their minds are once vitiated by passion or evil principle,
are by no means a security from their actually taking their
part against the public tranquillity. We see to what low
and despicable passion of all kinds many men in that class
are ready to sacrifice the patrimonial estates which might be
perpetuated in their families with splendour, and with the
fame of hereditary benefactors to mankind, from generation
to generation. Do we not see how lightly people treat their
fortunes when they are under the passion of gaming? The
game of resentment or ambition will be played by many of
the great and rich as desperately and with as much blindness
to the consequences as any other game. Passion blinds
them to the consequences as far as they concern themselves,
and as to the consequences with regard to others, they are
no part of their consideration.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The other night I met some clerks in the Foreign Office
to whom the very name of Palmerston is hateful, but I was
surprised to hear them (Mellish particularly, who can judge
both from capacity and opportunity), give ample testimony
to his abilities. They said that he wrote admirably, and
could express himself perfectly in French, very sufficiently
in Italian, and understood German; that his diligence and
attention were unwearied&mdash;he read everything and wrote an
immense quantity; that the foreign Ministers (who detest
him) did him justice as an excellent man of business. His
great fault is want of punctuality, and never caring for an
engagement if it did not suit him, keeping everybody waiting
for hours on his pleasure or caprice. This testimony is
beyond suspicion, and it is confirmed by the opinions of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PALMERSTON AS A MAN OF BUSINESS.</span>
colleagues; but it is certain that he cut a very poor figure in
Parliament all the time he was in office before.</p>

<p>At the Travellers&rsquo; yesterday I fell in with Bülow, who is
just come back from Berlin to resume his mission. He told
me that he was on such terms with Palmerston that it was
impossible for him to stay here, and that for some time past
he had given up communicating with him except upon the
most indispensable matters and in the most formal way.
He then gave me an account of the reception of the news of
the change of our Government at Berlin, where the Emperor
of Russia happened to be at the time. The Empress had
come there on a visit to her father, and the Emperor (who
is supposed to have preserved his conjugal fidelity immaculate)
had rushed from Moscow without any notice to see her,
and was still there when news of this great event arrived.
There is something very characteristic in the first impression
which the intelligence produced, at once manifesting the
secret wishes of the party and their ignorance and apparent
incapacity of comprehending the nature of our Constitution,
and the limited extent of the power of the King of England.
The Emperor immediately conceived that the whole
system of the late Government would be reversed at home
and abroad, that Leopold would be driven from Belgium,
the Dutch dominion restored, and the Quadruple Alliance
dissolved. Bülow, who has been in England long enough
to know better the real state of things, endeavoured to
undeceive him, and succeeded, though not without great
difficulty; but when he proceeded to explain to him that the
new Government would very likely not be able to keep their
places, and that at any rate they would be compelled to
conduct the Government upon the principle of Reform which
the late Government had established, the Emperor could not
by any means comprehend it, nor why or how there could be
any difficulty in keeping their places if the King was resolved
to support them, and had appointed them at his own
pleasure. It would seem as if they had never read the last
two or three years of our history, or, having read it, as if the
habits of unbounded power in which they are born, educated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and expect to die, had rendered their understandings utterly
impervious to the apparent paradox of a crowned head
destitute of power to choose his own Ministers. The Duke
of Cumberland, who was likewise there, began by talking
the same nonsense, and was full of the destruction of the
Reform Bill; but Billy Holmes, who, whatever else he may
be, is a very sharp fellow, succeeded in muzzling him. This
account which Bülow gave me is, however, more than
amusing; it is instructive, because it shows which way the
real wishes of the absolute sovereigns point, and makes it
highly probable that they look upon the present settlement
of Europe as one only <i>ad interim</i>, and to be remodelled
whenever an opportunity shall present itself. They are
satisfied at present with damming and dyking out the waters
of Liberalism, but they hope to drain the lands in which
they are collected, and to place themselves for ever out of
the danger of an inundation. The war of opinions is in fact
declared; it may languish, there may be truces, but there
will be no peace in our time.</p>

<h3>February 19th, 1835</h3>

<p>The important day is arrived, and it
dawns in sunshine and south wind. In a few hours the
question of the Speakership will be decided, and there will
at least be the gain (wherever the loss may fall) of getting
rid of a subject which has become intolerably tiresome.
For the last three weeks every newspaper has been literally
filled with the controversy, every club engaged in betting on
the event; in every room, at the corner of every street,
nobody talked of anything else. It was the first enquiry of
every man you met, &lsquo;Well, what do you hear to-day? they
say Sutton will win by 30.&rsquo; The next man (a Whig) would
say, &lsquo;It is safe; Abercromby will have 317 votes sure&rsquo;&mdash;each
party unboundedly confident, and both securing a
retreat by declaring that defeat will not signify. Half the
Opposition think it a false move to try it, and the more
sober of the Government are conscious that a defeat will be
very injurious.</p>

<p>We had a Council yesterday, and a levee more than
usually brilliant; all the new Ministers and all the old, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ELECTION OF SPEAKER ABERCROMBY.</span>
whole Corps Diplomatique, with a host of others, mixed up
in the first <i>entrée</i> room, and all very civil and good-humoured.
The King received the ex-Ministers very graciously, and
talked to them all, at least to all I saw pass by. Brougham
alone was absent, and Lord Spencer, who was hardly to be
considered as one of them, and is not in town, though,
by-the-bye, I think I am wrong in this, because there were
others whom I did not see&mdash;Duncannon, Spring Rice, and
Hobhouse.</p>

<h3>February 20th, 1835</h3>

<p>The great battle is over and the Government
defeated, 316 to 306. Such a division never was
known before in the House of Commons, and the accuracy
of the calculations is really surprising. Mulgrave told me
three days ago they had 317 people, which with the Teller
makes the exact number. Holmes went over the other list,
and made it 307&mdash;also correct. In the House so justly had
they reckoned, that when the numbers first counted (306)
were told to Duncannon in the lobby he said, &lsquo;Then we
shall win by 10.&rsquo; Burdett and Cobbett went away, which
with Tellers makes a total of 626 members in the House.
All the Irish members voted but 4, all the Scotch but 3, all
the English but 25. The Irish and Scotch, in fact, made
the majority.</p>

<p>The elation on one side and the depression on the other
were naturally considerable, and there was not time last
night to adjust scattered thoughts. Much money was won
and lost; everybody betted. I won 55&#8467;., for on the whole
I thought (though quite a toss-up) that the chances were
rather in favour of Abercromby. I had a better opinion of
the cleverness of the managers on his side, and their amazing
confidence staggered me, so that after at first believing
Sutton to be sure, I finished by leaning the other way. The
debate seems to have been dull&mdash;Sutton was dull, Peel was
dull; Stanley clever, strong against the Opposition, but
thought to have been indiscreet. A Tory told me it was a
second edition of the thimblerig speech, which, if so, will not
do him good. He carried apparently very few people with
him, but made one convert&mdash;Angerstein&mdash;who changed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
vote because Stanley made out that Abercromby was for the
Ballot. This seems an excellent reason why he should be
opposed as a Minister or a candidate, but none why he
should not sit in the chair of the House. Lord John Russell
is said to have spoken remarkably well, which is important to
them as a party, being his first appearance as their leader.
Peel and the Duke dined at Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s, and all the
Tories were invited there in the evening, with the intention
probably of celebrating their anticipated victory; and, if so,
their merry meeting must have been changed to dismal
alarms, for there is no denying or concealing that it is a
very serious disaster. The moral effect of beginning with a
defeat is bad; it discourages the wavering and timid, who
might have felt half disposed to support the Government
and the constitution. The trial of strength leads to very
uncomfortable reflections, for every man of these 317 is
prepared to go all lengths; and though there are probably
none among the majority who will support Government,
there are some among the minority who will oppose them&mdash;Dudley
Stuart, Angerstein, and Burdett, who went away.</p>

<p>The majority of the world naturally look at this event
with the eye of party, and as a triumph one way and a
mortification the other; but I, who have no party prejudices
and predilections, and care nothing who is in the chair, and
not much who is in office, provided &lsquo;the thing,&rsquo; as Cobbett
calls it, is kept going, look at this division with sorrow and
alarm, as affording undoubted evidence that no prospect
appears of the possibility of this or any other Government
being able to accomplish the purposes for which a Government
is intended. We seem to be arrived at what is vulgarly
termed a dead lock. Nothing can be more clear than
that the present Ministers are in a minority, and that all the
other parties in the House united can beat them when they
will. It is equally clear that they can beat any section of
their opponents whenever these are disunited. The political
attraction which binds together the mass cannot last long,
and there are too many elements of repulsion in <i>esse</i> or in
<i>posse</i> not to insure the speedy disjunction of the several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PARTIES BALANCED.</span>
atoms; but in the meantime, if they can be held together,
what is to happen? Peel will take a beating or two, but he
<i>may</i> be so beaten as to be compelled to resign or again
dissolve. Suppose he dissolves. The Tories think the reaction
is on the increase, and that the Conservative interest
would gain largely by another dissolution; still there is
scarcely a hope of their gaining enough to enable Peel to
carry on the Government with such constant and dependible
majorities as can alone render it efficacious and secure. On
the other hand, if Peel resigns, the Opposition, should they
return to power, must dissolve; for what can they do against
300 Tories? and what Ministry can by possibility be formed
that can have a certain majority <i>of its own</i> out of the heterogeneous
mixture of Whigs, Radicals, Repealers, and men
of every shade and gradation of opinion? Their situation,
notwithstanding their victory, seems worse than that of
their antagonists with reference to their power as a party;
and if they do storm Downing Street and St. James&rsquo;s, and
go again to the country, as far as appearances go, what
chance have they of materially bettering their condition,
and getting another House of Commons more manageable
and better adapted to their purpose than this? This
victory, therefore, will not enable the old Government to
triumph over the new, or materially affect the positions of
the two parties, and, as somebody said last night, they will
be very much puzzled what to do with their majority now
they have got it.</p>

<p>The first impression of great events is generally one
of alarm, which upon this occasion subsequent reflection
has diminished as far as relates to the <i>immediate</i> peril of
the present Government. Speculation already began last
night as to the Address, on which some pretend no amendment
will be moved, others that one will, which as certainly
will be carried. No question can, however, be more embarrassing
to the Whig leaders, for they would be disposed
in prudence to abstain from any very violent measure, but
will find great difficulty in dealing with their associates. If
they resolve upon pushing their victory and amending the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Address, they run the risk of exciting terror by their violence;
if they avoid this, probably some of the Radicals will do it,
and then they must support Government on the Address
against a Radical section of the House, or join with the
Radicals in one of two ways, either by supporting their
amendment or persuading them to withdraw it; in either
case drawing closer the bonds of that connexion which they
are ashamed and afraid to avow, and which will, I strongly
incline to believe, be in the end fatal to the Whig party.
The only thing that can truly be predicted is, that all is
confusion, uncertainty, embarrassment, a state of things
full of difficulty and peril, but not <i>totally</i> without hope.</p>

<h3>February 21st, 1835</h3>

<p>The Government were grievously annoyed
at the event of Thursday, and the Duke rejected all the
commonplaces of consolation, &lsquo;that it would turn out a good
thing.&rsquo; At Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s dinner (to which Peel did not
go) they were all very dejected, and the Duke said at once it
was as bad as could be; and the thing appeared the worse
because they had been led to feel so very secure. He desired
his private secretary to have everything ready to quit
the Foreign Office at a moment&rsquo;s notice. However, at dinner
yesterday at Peel&rsquo;s (a great dinner to all the Ambassadors
and twenty-six people) he said to me, &lsquo;It is very bad, but I
consider the country <i>on its legs again</i>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do you ?&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;I am glad you think so.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, yes, I think that, however
this may end; I think the country is on its legs again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Whigs are resolved to push their victory with all
their energies, and they appear to have no doubt of ousting
the Government, and as they are determined to proceed by
any and every means in their career, and the others are
equally resolved to fight the battle while any means of resistance
remain, the strife must be deadly, and such as
to extinguish any hope of a coalition between moderate
men of both sides for the simple reason that moderation
has ascended to Heaven, and such men will no longer be
found.</p>

<h3>February 23rd, 1835</h3>

<p>The Opposition mean to move an amendment
to the Address, which they expect to carry by a larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FIERCE OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT.</span>
majority than the last. Their tactics are completely arranged,
and their understanding with O&rsquo;Connell and all the
Radicals so good that they think there is no danger of any
indiscreet ebullition in any quarter. Discarding every prospective
consideration, and prepared to encounter all consequences,
they concentrate all their energies upon the single
object of turning out the Government, in which they have
no doubt of succeeding. It is the first time (as far as I
know) that any great party ever proceeded upon, and avowed,
such a principle as that which binds these people together
and puts them in action; namely, to destroy the King&rsquo;s
Ministry, without any reference to the measures that Ministry
may propose, and without waiting to see how they may
intend to carry on the Government. Not only do they
throw out of their consideration the conduct of the Administration,
but they are resolved to accomplish its destruction,
without being prepared to substitute any stronger Government
in its room, and with a perfect knowledge that its
dissolution must necessarily produce a state of extraordinary
embarrassment, from which they do not pretend to have the
power of extricating the country. All that they ever condescend
to say, in answer to any such remonstrances, is this:
&lsquo;The King exercised his prerogative in a most extraordinary
and unjustifiable manner. We have the same right to reject
his Government, that he had to turn out ours; if there
is embarrassment, it is none of our creating, the King and
the Tories must be responsible for it. We care not what
are the principles now avowed by them. If they are not
Reformers, they cannot govern this country, and are not to
be tolerated at the head of affairs. If they are, it is not to
be endured that they should usurp our places, and then in
defiance of all their principles, and in opposition to all their
previous conduct, carry into effect the measures which we
should, with perfect consistency, have brought forward. We
will listen therefore to nothing. Out they shall go, and till
we have got them out, we will never rest, nor desist from
our attacks.&rsquo; &lsquo;Quid sit futurum cras, fuge quærere,&rsquo; such is
the manner of their reasoning. Their intention seems to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to avoid doing anything very desperate, but to keep beating
the Government, constantly exhibiting their own power
and the helpless state of their adversaries to the world.
Some of them affect to deny their union with O&rsquo;Connell, but
they say whatever suits their present purpose. In the case
of Manners Sutton, they took care to have the charges
against him disseminated through the country, and did their
best to have them believed. The constituencies believed them,
and instructed their representatives accordingly; and when,
by these means, they had secured a majority, they came down
at the last moment to the House of Commons and owned that
there was not one word of truth in the allegations against
him. John Russell had written a letter (perhaps more than
one) in which he urged opposition to Sutton, on the ground
of his having advised the dissolution of the last Parliament.
Goulburn got possession of this letter, which was handed to
him during the debate, he does not know by whom. (Goulburn
told me this himself.) He gave it to Peel while he
was speaking, or just before. Peel asked John Russell if he
had ever said so, and John Russell denied it. Peel did not
produce the letter as he might have done, but the story was
told in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; the next day. So in the case of the
Bishop of Exeter, and Lord John&rsquo;s controversy with him. He
told an untruth, undoubtedly without knowing it, but he
might have known it; the lie did its business&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p style="text-indent: 0">and though he afterwards made a very handsome apology,
half the people who were influenced by the original statement
never heard of the contradiction, or cared for it, if they did;
and to show the candour of the Liberal press, the &lsquo;Morning
Chronicle,&rsquo; and other papers of that persuasion, which
trumpeted forth the original lie, never inserted the subsequent
correspondence, and Lord John&rsquo;s contradiction of his own
statement. I like him so much personally, that I am sorry
for all this. To return to the party, they are boiling with
indignation at the idea of another dissolution, and talk of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">UNION WITH O&rsquo;CONNELL.</span>
such advice to the King as affording good ground for impeachment,
though till they have settled the House of Lords,
and had their wicked will of it, the Ministers would be
pretty safe before that tribunal for such an act. It is the
general opinion that Peel will dissolve, and go once more to
the country if he can, but this must depend upon the sort of
opposition they offer, and the majorities they can bring into
the field. Adolphus FitzClarence told me that he never saw
the King so determined as he is to stand by this Government
to the last, and I do not think any of these men will
prove deficient in courage.</p>

<h3>February 24th, 1835</h3>

<p>The Opposition expect a majority of
from thirty to forty on the amendment. The union with
O&rsquo;Connell is complete, however long it may last, and he has
agreed to give up Repeal, and they are to find some lucrative
place for him when they get in again. What he wants is
to be a Master of the Rolls in Ireland; the rent fails, and
money he must have. It is a wretched thing that there is
no buying that man <i>now</i> without disgrace; well would it have
been to have made the purchase long ago; and it will not
be the least curious part of his curious life if this bargain
takes place, and he settles down into the regular discharge
of his professional duties, and <i>bonâ fide</i> abandons agitation.
There was great curiosity last night to know whether the
Speaker dined with Peel. It is usual for him to dine with
the leader of the House of Commons on these occasions, and
hear the speech read. Sutton always dined with Althorp,
but then Althorp put him in the chair. Abercromby, however,
very properly told Peel the difficulty he felt, and that
he thought he should only embarrass the company, and Peel
acquiesced in his excuse.</p>

<h3>February 25th, 1835</h3>

<p>The King went down to Parliament in
the midst of a vast crowd, and was neither well nor ill received;
nobody takes his hat off, but there was some slight
cheering. The speech disappointed me, it was rather bald,
and so thought some of the moderate men. In the morning
there was a meeting at the King&rsquo;s Head, Palace Yard, to
which moderate members of Parliament were invited by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
anonymous circular. Thirty-three were present, Sir Oswald
Mosley in the chair. Graham came to it, and said Lord
Stanley would have come also, but that he had invited a few
of his friends to assemble at his house, with an object similar
to that which had brought the present
meeting<a name="FNA_27_02" id="FNA_27_02"></a><a href="#FN_27_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
together and
that if it were agreeable to any of these gentlemen to meet
his friends that afternoon he should be glad to see them.
They all went, and there were present forty-five or fifty, of
whom eight had voted for Abercromby. He made them a
speech, stating that it was evident the Government must
fall if they were to be repeatedly defeated, and his view of
the necessity of obstructing violent measures directed against
them was something to this effect. The result was an agreement
to meet again this day, and last night a few more
names were added to their list. This may, therefore, be
considered the Stanley party, and the best thing that can
happen will be that this party should grow numerous. Many
men do not like the composition of the Government, and yet
wish to support it, without being identified with it, as the
majority of those who attend the meetings are disposed to
support Peel. Stanley securing them as his adherents, and
placing himself at their head, must in fact subscribe to their
opinions and disposition; and as men are more inclined to
join a numerous than a scanty sect, fresh adherents may
repair to that standard. Eventually he will join the Government,
and the best chance of weathering the storm will be
through this moderate Liberal party.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_27_02" id="FN_27_02"></a><a href="#FNA_27_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[This meeting (which will probably have important results, as it was
the foundation of that which met afterwards at Stanley&rsquo;s, and the formation
of this party will turn the balance on the Conservative side) originated in
the most insignificant causes. Sir Oswald Mosley, an ordinary person, and
a Mr. Young, talking the thing over, suggested to one another to try and
get together moderate men, and they penned and sent out a parcel of notes
addressed to those who they thought came under that description, bearing
no signature, and giving no indication of the quarter from which they
emanated. When the thirty-three people who came were assembled, they
found themselves for the most part strangers to each other, and each asking
who such and such an one was. When Graham invited any who chose to
go to Lord Stanley&rsquo;s, Mosley rather wanted to decline, to go on with his
own meeting, and play an important part, but nobody would hear of this, so
he was obliged to go with the rest to Stanley&rsquo;s house.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS.</span>
The debate was opened by Sandon in a speech feebly
delivered, but containing good matter. Morpeth made a
good speech, moving the amendment. The debate was very
dull indeed, Dr. Bowring a total failure. It was expected
the House would adjourn, if not divide, and the Speaker put
the question, when Peel got up. It was curious to see the
lulling of the uproar, and the shuffling and scrambling into
seats, till all was quiet and the whole coast clear. He spoke
very ably for nearly two hours and a half, his speech not
containing much oratory, but in a tone at once lofty and
firm, yet discreet, calculated to inspire confidence and to
make an impression on all who are impressible. There is
no use in entering into details of speeches which are now
reported with such perfect fidelity. This may not be without
its effect on Stanley&rsquo;s meeting to-day, and his speech will be
listened to with intense anxiety to-night. The Opposition
(as Duncannon told me) expected a majority of between
thirty and forty, so that if it is considerably less than that,
it will be tantamount to a defeat.</p>

<h3>February 26th, 1835</h3>

<p>Stanley spoke last night, attacking both
sides, not violently, but announcing his intention to vote
against the amendment. The Government were annoyed at
his speech, especially at his expressing some sort of disapprobation
of the Duke of Wellington, which he would have
done well to omit, for many reasons. Lord John Russell, by
universal admission even of his enemies, made an excellent
speech. I did not hear either him or Stanley. John has
surpassed all expectations hitherto, as leader, which is matter
of great exultation to his party, but the tide is already beginning
to turn, and there are evident symptoms of weakness
in the great unwieldy heterogeneous body he is at the head
of. Tavistock came to me yesterday morning, and told me
his brother had sent for him, &lsquo;finding himself in difficulties.&rsquo;
He did not particularise them, but said that naturally, in a
situation of such novelty, he found considerable difficulties
to contend with. He owned that the meeting at Lichfield
House, which O&rsquo;Connell had attended by invitation, had
alarmed and disgusted many of the old Whigs, and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
settled there should be no more such meetings. Then there
has been some little correspondence between Ward and Lord
John about the Irish Church question, the former wishing to
manage the matter, which he brought forward last year, and
he wrote to John about it, who replied rather shortly, that
he himself intended to submit a motion on the subject. This
is a trifle, but trifles like these contribute to form an aggregate
of importance, and the moment there is any beginning
of disunion or weakness in such a party, a very short time
will make it fall to pieces.</p>

<p>Lord Stanley assembled his followers again yesterday to the
number of about fifty; other adhesions, and half-adhesions,
occurred in the course of the evening, and the result is an
expectation that the boasted majority of thirty or forty will
dwindle down to four or five, or perhaps be no majority at
all. The erection of this standard will therefore, in all probability,
save the Government, and defeat the factious designs
of the great Whig and Radical coalition; but I distrust
Stanley himself, and see the great chance there is of his
vanity and selfish ambition producing other difficulties, the
pressure of which, though he may not feel it now, will some
time hence become heavy to him. His object at present is
to gather to himself the largest party he can; but though he
may lead them, he can only lead them the way they are
minded to go, and the design of his friends is to show
themselves Conservatives without being Tories, to save this
Government, not from love to it, but from fear of its opponents
and of the alternative. He certainly may have the
appearance of being the arbiter of all great questions, and
actually be so to a certain degree, but as his ultimate object
must be his return to office, he can only hope to return (at
least with any prospects of success) with Peel and the Tories.
It is, therefore, egregious folly in him, by an affectation of
neutrality and independence, to shock and disgust that great
body, which must ever be the strength of a Conservative
Government, by twitting the Duke of Wellington and
attacking with sarcasms or reproaches certain measures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POSITION OF LORD STANLEY.</span>
or omissions, or particular members of Government, and
especially the Duke himself. The Duke is, after all, the idol
of the Tories, and they will not endure that a youth like
Stanley shall avail himself of his accidental advantages to
treat their great man with levity and disrespect; and all this
he has not coolness, sagacity, and temper enough to see, nor
to discern that his most becoming and dignified course would
be to conduct himself with a seriousness and gravity suitable
to the importance of the crisis and of the part he aspires to
play and the magnitude of the interests which are at stake.
If he believes in his conscience that the Opposition are animated
with a spirit of faction, and that their triumph would
be the forerunner of revolution or confusion, he should take
his stand on a great principle, and support the Government
in such a manner as might best enable it to confound the
schemes of its antagonists; but all this time he is dreading
to be called a Tory, and he does not certainly give up the
hope and notion of reuniting himself with the moderate
section of his late colleagues. He endeavours to keep up an
amicable intercourse with them, and to make them believe
that he has no intention of connecting himself more closely
with this Government. Such ambiguous conduct, and his
occasional asperities and incivilities, have begun already to
disgust and alienate the Tories; and though they have too
much need of him now not to be obliged to restrain the
expression of their feelings, the time may come when he
will have need of them, and he will then find the inconvenient
consequences of his present behaviour.</p>

<h3>February 27th, 1835</h3>

<p>They divided at half-past one this morning,
309 to 302. I went over the list before dinner, and
made out a majority of six (correct all but one). Gisborne,
Howick, and Graham spoke tolerably, O&rsquo;Connell very good
for the first ten minutes, and very bad all the rest. I was
not there. Certainly Stanley&rsquo;s conduct is queer. Notwithstanding
the sharp things he said against Government in his
speech on Wednesday, and various little marks of scorn he
throws out here and there, he said to Francis Egerton on
Tuesday, after all the Opposition men had been speaking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
&lsquo;Why does not Peel get up, or at least put up one of the
Government, to put an end to all this balderdash?&rsquo; Francis
went and told Peel, who was very much out of sorts (at the
state of the debate I suppose), and asked rather angrily for
Sir G. Clerk. Francis went to look for Clerk, and when he
returned Peel was on his legs. This he told me yesterday
morning.</p>

<h3>March 5th, 1835</h3>

<p>Met Mulgrave at dinner at Seaford&rsquo;s, and he
still talks with confidence of turning the Government out;
that five or six of Stanley&rsquo;s tail have whisked round again to
the Whigs; that they can beat the Government on every
question by greater majorities than on the two they have
already tried, which were the worst for them, and that any
other Government (of their party) would get through the
business of the session.</p>

<h3>March 11th, 1835</h3>

<p>The repeal of the malt tax was defeated by
a majority of 158, much more than was necessary, and it is
thought that Government would have done wisely, when they
found they were sure of not being beaten, to allow their friends
to redeem their pledges (or as many of them as stood deeply
committed), for it will be found that several of them will
suffer greatly from this vote in their counties. Peel (as
usual) made an admirable speech; he continues to distinguish
himself by a marked superiority, both in oratory and management,
which cannot fail to produce a great effect both in
the House of Commons and the country. There is nobody
who approaches him, and every day he displays more and
more his capacity for government and undoubted fitness for the
situation he is in. He cannot help being a great man,
because he lives in an age of pigmies; and he will be as great
as great talents without a great mind can make anybody.
Even some of the violent Radicals say that if Peel&rsquo;s associates
could be disposed of, they would not object to him.</p>

<h3>March 13th, 1835</h3>

<p>There was a meeting of the Opposition at
Lichfield House yesterday, to consider what they should do
about Hume&rsquo;s motion to grant the supplies for three months,
and the result was that the design should be abandoned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">APPOINTMENT OF LORD LONDONDERRY.</span>
Thus they have shown their teeth without daring to bite.
Many of their people would not have gone with them, and if
this grand project failed <i>now</i> thus early in the session, still
less chance will it have at a later period. Peel&rsquo;s skill and
great superiority, and the disunion and uncertainty of the
vast unwieldy body opposed to him, will carry him through.</p>

<h3>March 14th, 1835</h3>

<p>Last night was a terribly damaging night
to the Government, and fully justifies all that I, in common
with almost everybody else, thought of that miserable appointment
of Londonderry.<a name="FNA_27_03" id="FNA_27_03"></a><a href="#FN_27_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Shiel brought it forward, and
a storm burst from every side. Stanley made a strong speech
against it, and Mahon totally broke down. Peel spoke
cleverly, as usual, but fighting under difficulties, and dodging
about, and shifting his ground with every mark of weakness.
The result is that Londonderry cannot go, and must either
resign or his nomination be cancelled. This is miserable
weakness on the part of the Government, and an awkward
position to be placed in. It is very questionable if the Duke
of Wellington will not resign upon it, which would make
another great embarrassment, for there is nobody to fill his
place. It serves the Government right, and the Duke especially,
for having built up such a wall to run their heads
against. They knew the loathing people had for the man, how
odious and ridiculous he had made himself, how obnoxious
and indefensible the appointment would be, and yet, though
there was no reason or occasion for it, and their circumstances
were so difficult that the utmost caution and prudence
were requisite in all their subordinate and collateral proceedings,
as well as in the great and essential ones, they had the
blind and obstinate folly to make this appointment. It is
not <i>contempt</i> of public opinion in the Duke, but it is that
ignorance or indifference, or disregard of it, which has been
the besetting sin of his political life, and has so largely
affected his political sayings and doings. Peel ought to have
known better, and have taken a more correct view of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
position, and the effect such an appointment would have on
it. It is difficult to say what consequences may flow from
this affair. The Government can stand no shocks and
buffets; if they go on, it can only be by the most dexterous
management, and by obtaining constant advantages in the
petty and daily warfare of Parliament, and thus gathering
confidence by degrees, that they can accomplish it. It would
be too mortifying if such a man should be the cause of the
downfall of the Government and of all the evils that would
result therefrom. Knatchbull, who was dragged into the
discussion by Peel (in order to make a diversion), defended
himself and spoke remarkably well. He is the only Cabinet
Minister who has shown anything like a faculty to support
Peel. It was rather amusing to see the attempt of Peel to
take the dogs off the scent of Londonderry and throw them
on that of Knatchbull; but they were soon whipped off, and
put again upon the right track. There was one good hit.
A Sir George Strickland, attacking Knatchbull, said, &lsquo;Talk of
the Right Honourable Baronet as a Reformer, indeed, when
<i>I remember</i> his coming down night after night during the
Reform Bill, and opposing every part and particle of it, clause
after clause,&rsquo; when Knatchbull took his hat off and said, &lsquo;I
was not a member of that Parliament.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_27_03" id="FN_27_03"></a><a href="#FNA_27_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[The Marquis of Londonderry had been appointed Ambassador to St.
Petersburg.]</p></div>

<h3>March 15th, 1835</h3>

<p>The Londonderry debate has made a great
sensation, and is a source of prodigious triumph and exultation
to the Opposition. In the morning I met Lady Peel,
who was full of compassion for Londonderry, and said, &lsquo;He
had behaved very nobly about it.&rsquo; Nobody doubts that he
cannot go, whether he resigns voluntarily or not; but, end
how it may, it is a disastrous occurrence. If Government
should persist in the appointment, they would be beaten by a
great majority, and the House of Commons would vote him
out; if it is given up, it is a monstrous concession to the
violence and power of the House of Commons, for however
objectionable the appointment may have been, it is not so
outrageous as to call for the interference of Parliament with
the King&rsquo;s undoubted prerogative, and on the whole the
principle of such interference may be considered more inconvenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE ON LORD LONDONDERRY.</span>
than submitting to the appointment itself. It will
probably lead before long to other encroachments upon the
Executive power, and we shall soon see the House of Commons
interfering about everything.</p>

<p>In the evening I met the Duke of Wellington at Lady
Howe&rsquo;s, who talked about the affair, and said that he was
not particularly partial to the man, nor ever had been; but
that he was very fit for that post, was an excellent Ambassador,
procured more information and obtained more
insight into the affairs of a foreign Court than anybody, and
that he was the best relater of what passed at a conference,
and wrote the best account of a conversation, of any man he
knew. I said this might be all true, but that though <i>he</i>
knew it, the generality of people did not, and the public could
only judge of him by what they heard or read of his speeches,
and what was related of his conduct on former occasions;
that on that account he was very obnoxious, and that his
violent and intemperate attacks upon the foreign policy of
the late Government, the sentiments he had displayed generally,
had raised a great prejudice against him, and I had
therefore been sure from the moment I heard of the appointment
that it would be severely attacked, and regretted exceedingly
for that reason that it had ever been made. I had
told Lady Peel the same thing, for it is difficult to resist
telling them the real truth; and I know not why it should
not be told them.</p>

<p>Last night I met Lord Howick, who is bitter enough
against the Ministers, and expressed his earnest desire that
they might be well dragged through the mire, but not be
turned out. I asked, &lsquo;Why, if he wished they should stay in,
he desired that they should be discredited?&rsquo; and he replied,
&lsquo;That it would be very difficult <i>at present</i> to replace them, but
that he saw the prospective means, and he would have them go
on till the time was ripe for change, but that they should be
made every day more odious.&rsquo; These means, I doubt not, are
the reconciliation of Stanley with the Whigs, which is clearly
contemplated by both one and the other. Hobhouse&rsquo;s speech
the other night was very civil to Stanley, no doubt with that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
view, and much personal intimacy is affected between him
and the Whig leaders. Then much light is thrown upon it
in my mind by the account I have just heard from Charlton
(who enlisted under the Stanley banner) of the tone and
<i>animus</i> displayed at the last meeting at Stanley&rsquo;s. There
Stanley was pressed by Mr. Young to declare in strong terms
his want of confidence in the Government; and Patrick
Stewart said that if Hume&rsquo;s motion, for limiting the supplies
to three months, was placed in the hands of Lord John
Russell, he thought he must vote for it. Stanley opposed
this suggestion, and declared his disapprobation (let who
would bring it on) of so strong a measure as stopping the
supplies, and he said he thought the want of confidence
might be sufficiently evinced without having recourse to
any murderous measures, anything absolutely destructive
of the Government. The general tone and disposition
of the meeting was very inimical to the present Ministry,
and Charlton was himself so little satisfied with what passed,
and especially with Stanley&rsquo;s apparent bias and feeling, that
he wrote to him to say that he had joined his party on the
express notion that he was prepared to give the Government
a fair trial, and to ask whether he did not understand
him correctly in attributing to him still such an intention.
He replied very courteously, and tolerably satisfactorily, but
it certainly seems probable that he is more disposed to reunite
with his old friends than to form any connection with these
men, though what is uppermost in his mind is to raise his
own consequence and authority, and make the best bargain
he eventually can. Charlton says that he has since
tried to engage him in conversation upon the subject of the
democratic tendency of the times, but that he has no mind
to discuss the subject. Charlton is such a violent, foolish,
dangerous fellow, that it is no wonder if Stanley kept
aloof from him, and was not disposed to be more than merely
civil to him.</p>

<h3>March 17th, 1835</h3>

<p>Londonderry made a good speech in the
House of Lords last night, gentlemanlike and temperate.
He got a good deal of empty praise in both Houses in lieu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD LONDONDERRY&rsquo;S DEFENCE.</span>
of the solid pudding he is obliged to give up. He said
&lsquo;that he had had no communication with the Government,
nor had sought any advice, neither had any been tendered
to him; that he had after due deliberation determined
on the course he should pursue.&rsquo; All this is untrue; he went
to Peel on Saturday morning, and told him he was ready to
do what he pleased; but Peel said he could give him no
opinion. He then consulted various people, the Dukes of
Cumberland and Buckingham <i>inter alios</i>, who advised him
not to resign. It appeared to be his object to obtain
opinions to that effect, and up to late yesterday afternoon
nobody knew what he meant to do; so much so, that the
Duke left the Foreign Office without being apprised of his
intentions, and desired if any letter came from him that it
might be sent after him to the House of Lords. He received
the letter on the stairs, which he read and instantly sent to
Peel. It has altogether been a miserable affair, and it is
certainly true what John Russell said, that in &lsquo;the experiment
they are now making, that which the Right Honourable
Baronet called a fair trial, they were running considerable
hazard that the most useful prerogatives of the Crown would
lose that dignity and respect in which they had formerly been
held.&rsquo; It is clearly true that this most dangerous precedent
of interference has occurred because the Government has
not strength to prevent it, and because we have the anomaly
of a Government beating up against a hostile majority. The
man was utterly unfit, and ought never to have been
appointed, but the case against him (such as it appears in
their hands) is quite insufficient to warrant the interference of
Parliament.</p>

<p>I take it that the effect abroad will be prodigious, for
though Londonderry resigns of his own accord, and Peel
says he would have stood by him if he had not, the simple
case is (and such will be the appearance of it all over
Europe) that the King appointed Londonderry Ambassador
to Russia, and the House of Commons cancelled the appointment.</p>

<p>Everything meanwhile continues in a state of uncertainty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
The Opposition is not united; the Stanley party, with their
leader, observe a suspicious and suspected neutrality, but the
Government is at their mercy whenever they join the
Opposition, or, indeed, if they keep aloof. Such a state of
things cannot go on very long, and the fate of the Government
must be settled one way or the other. Every day
produces fresh indications of Peel&rsquo;s superiority, and his
capacity for the lead in the House of Commons, but he
does not appear to have gained much in those points where
he was most deficient&mdash;cordiality and communicativeness.
Francis Egerton came to me to-day and complained that on
the Londonderry debate, finding that nobody spoke on the
Treasury Bench, he went and sat by Peel and offered to
speak, but could get no answer from him; and Ashley was
furious because when Hume asked for some information on
some point of Navy estimates, on which he (Ashley) had
taken pains to prepare himself, Peel would not let him give
it, but took it out of his hands. All this is very impolitic,
and shows that whatever else he has gained by experience,
he has not gained the art of making himself popular with
his own adherents in the way that Castlereagh and Canning
used to be; and therefore, however he may be looked up to
as a Minister, he will never be followed with the same
personal devotion that they commanded.</p>

<h3>March 20th, 1835</h3>

<p>I have been laid up with the gout all this
week, and could not go out to see and hear what is going on.
On Tuesday night Peel brought in the Dissenters&rsquo; Marriage
Bill, and his plan gave almost general satisfaction except
to those whom nothing can satisfy. The Opposition papers
gave it a sort of cold and sulky approbation, evincing how
little the loudest advocates for reforms of this nature really
care about them. The &lsquo;Morning Chronicle&rsquo; seemed to
regret that Peel&rsquo;s Bill should give satisfaction more than it
rejoiced that the Dissenters were to obtain it. Marriage is
made a civil contract for the Dissenters, and a slight civil
form is substituted for the religious ceremony of the Church
of England. This relieves them from all their grievance;
but it is now said that they lie under a degradation, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR EDWARD AND LADY SUGDEN.</span>
it is not also made a civil contract for everybody else, and
that the law ought to be changed universally. I think it
would be better if it was a civil contract, but nothing can be
more captious than such an objection, or more impertinent,
and I do not desire to see the law changed, because I believe
the majority of members of the Church of England are content
that it should remain as it is, and that their feelings or
prejudices would be shocked by the alteration.</p>

<p>The King is in great indignation at the proceedings in
the House of Commons about Londonderry. The Duke sent
Londonderry&rsquo;s letter of resignation to him, and his Majesty
returned it with a letter in which he expressed his approbation
of Londonderry&rsquo;s conduct, and added, that &lsquo;he was more
than ever satisfied of the correctness of his determination in
November last, to refuse his consent to his Government
being led by Lord John Russell in the House of Commons,
since he had witnessed his conduct upon the occasion, and
the support he had given to the unconstitutional attack that
had been made upon this appointment.&rsquo; He made no
allusion to Stanley, whose conduct must have galled him still
more.</p>

<p>Sir E. Sugden has resigned the Chancellorship of Ireland
because his wife is not received at Court. He might have
ascertained very easily beforehand what would happen, or
have contrived to keep her away from Dublin. It was
understood when he took the Great Seal that he declined
being made a peer, on account of the illegitimacy of his
eldest son. Half the world had never heard of Lady Sugden,
or knew anything of her history; and as she is an excellent
woman, charitable and kind-hearted, I fancy she has moved
without obstruction in his natural circle of society. He
went to Ireland before any Lord-Lieutenant was named, and
Lady Sugden was received as a matter of course. When
Lady Haddington was apprised of her origin and history she
foresaw the difficulty, and asked the Queen what she was to
do. Her Majesty told her to do what she pleased, but that
certainly she could not be received at Court here. The Lady-Lieutenant
therefore was compelled to decline receiving her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
for all Ireland would have been affronted had she received at
the Castle a lady not presentable at St. James&rsquo;s. Sugden
was very angry, and his indignation arose principally, it
would seem, from Lady Canterbury&rsquo;s having been received
at Court, which he considers (with some reason) as a case
equally flagrant. Her reception was a matter of bargain, I
forget at this moment on what occasion, and certainly a
strong measure. The talk is that James Parke will go to
Ireland, and Sugden return to the Bar, which will be hard
upon those who had shared his vast business, especially on
the silk gown men.</p>

<h3>March 21st, 1835</h3>

<p>Lord Grey is come to town; he is very
strong against the Radicals, and highly disgusted at so many
of them having been admitted to the Opposition meetings.
He and Stanley met with excessive cordiality. Sefton was
there when Stanley called upon him. The King received
Lord Grey at the levee with such civility and attention as to
excite peculiar observation.</p>

<h3>March 22nd, 1835</h3>

<p>A few nights ago Brougham was speaking
in the House of Lords (upon Lord Radnor&rsquo;s motion about
university oaths), and was attacking, or rather beginning to
attack, the Duke of Wellington in that tone of insolent sarcasm
which is so familiar to him, when in the midst of his
harangue the Duke from the opposite side lifted up his
finger, and said loud enough to be heard, &lsquo;Now take care
what you say next.&rsquo; As if panic-struck, Brougham broke
off, and ran upon some other tack. The House is so narrow,
that Lords can almost whisper to each other across it, and
the menacing action and words of the Duke reached
Brougham at once. This odd anecdote rests upon much
concurrent evidence. Alvanley told it to De Ros, and Lord
Salisbury said he was sitting close to the Duke, and witnessed
it all. The Chancellor afterwards confirmed it.</p>

<p>On Friday night, on the debate upon Irish Tithes, Peel
bowled down his opponents, Howick, Rice, and Thomson,
like so many ninepins; for, besides his vigour and power in
debate, his memory is so tenacious and correct, that they
never can make any mistakes without his detecting them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">COURAGE OF SIR R. PEEL.</span>
and he is inconceivably ready in all references to former
debates and their incidents, and the votes and speeches of
individual members. It cannot be denied that he is a great
performer in his present part. Old Sir Robert, who must
have been a man of exceeding shrewdness, predicted that his
full energies would never be developed till he was in the
highest place, and had the sole direction of affairs; and his
brother Lawrence, who told this to Henry de Ros, said that
in early youth he evinced the same obstinate and unsocial
disposition, which has since been so remarkable a feature of
his character. I wish he was not hampered with the Irish
Church fetters, which he cannot throw off.</p>

<p>Peel wrote a letter to Hume, demanding an explanation
of certain offensive expressions he had made use of in the
House of Commons, and got an answer, which was sufficient,
though not very civil. It was rather unnecessary that he
should take any notice of what Hume said, but Peel is a
man of very high and prompt courage, and seems to have
made a rule to himself never to suffer impertinence from any
quarter to pass unchecked. It is certainly of great service
to a public man, and it largely increases the estimation in
which he is held, to establish such a character. It is no
small detriment to Brougham that he is accounted an arrant
coward; and it is remarkable that Peel never was known to
deal in the insolence, and bullying, and offensive personalities
in which the other has so copiously indulged, both
in Parliament and at the Bar.</p>

<h3>March 24th, 1835</h3>

<p>A meeting at Lichfield&rsquo;s yesterday, when
they resolved to reserve themselves for the great battle on
Monday next, in full persuasion that Peel will resign after
the division. Whether he means it or not, I have no idea,
but it is surprising to me that they do not think it better to
attack him on his Tithe Bill than on the Appropriation
clause; for I think he must go out if beaten on the former, but
need not if beaten on the latter. They are, however, bent upon
his expulsion; and Lichfield (who is more or less in their
secrets) told me they feel no difficulty as to making another
Government under Melbourne&rsquo;s auspices. There was a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
dinner of the Opposition at the Duke of Sussex&rsquo;s on Sunday,
to which Brougham was not invited. It will not be the least
of their difficulties how to deal with him. Sugden, after all,
stays in Ireland. The Bar were up in arms at his menaced
return among them, which would have had the effect of half
ruining some of those who took silk gowns upon his retirement.
His absurdity will, therefore, have had no other effect
than that of revealing his wife&rsquo;s misfortune to the whole
world in a very noisy way. Lord Canterbury gives up Canada
on account of his wife&rsquo;s health, and probably not liking to
face the disagreeable things that would have been said about
himself and her. Lord Aberdeen has offered it to Stratford
Canning, who, though clever enough, is so <i>difficile à vivre</i>,
that nobody can be less calculated for conciliatory objects;
so that for a situation which required an agent of strong
understanding and good temper, they successively selected a
foolish man of good temper, and a clever man of bad.</p>

<h3>March 26th, 1835</h3>

<p>On Tuesday night Government was beaten on
a division about the Chatham election; a thing of no consequence
in itself, but the whole affair was mismanaged. John
Russell had said he should not divide, but his people were
not to be restrained. Peel would have given way, but his
whippers-in told him he was strong enough in the House to
carry it, which only shows how stupid they are. It is now
universally believed that he will resign next week, after the
division on John Russell&rsquo;s motion, upon which he is sure to
be beaten by twenty or thirty votes. I am inclined to believe
that he has made known his intentions to Stanley, for the
latter entertains no doubt on the subject. The Greyites are
all alive, and patting Lord Grey on the back all day long to
incline him to obey the summons they confidently expect him
to receive from the King. It is very obvious that Peel cannot
go on; and I doubt much if he could even were he to
obtain a majority on Monday. His physical strength would
not suffice for the harassing warfare that is waged against
him, the whole brunt of which he bears alone. This, however,
is his own fault, for he will not let anybody else take a
part, whether from distrust of his colleagues, or his own rage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">APPROACHING DEFEAT OF GOVERNMENT.</span>
for being all in all. Then, from the relative constitution of
the two parties, he must be in continual danger of defeats
upon minor and collateral questions, or suddenly started
points. His party is in great part composed of the rich and
fashionable, who are constantly drawn away by one attraction
or another, and whose habitual haunts are the clubs and
houses at the west end of the town; and it is next to impossible
to collect his scattered forces at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
The Opposition contains a dense body of fellows who have
no vocation out of the walls of the House of Commons; who
put up in the vicinity; either do not dine at all, or get their
meals at some adjoining chop-house, throng the benches
early, and never think of moving till everything is over;
constituting a steady, never-failing foundation, the slightest
addition to which will generally secure a majority in the
present state of the House. In old times the placemen and
immediate hangers-on of Government, who make it their
business to attend in order to carry the public business
through, afforded a regular certain majority for the Ministers
of the day; but now this household phalanx is outnumbered
by these blackguards, the chief of whom are O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s Tail
and the lower Radicals. All this immensely increases Peel&rsquo;s
embarrassment; and the tactics of his opponents have been
extremely able, considered with a view to obstruct the march
of Government. While the leaders have abstained from any
violent measure, and have always resolved at their consultations
not to stop the supplies or impede the public service,
their active partisans have taken good care to produce all
the same effects, by raising debate after debate upon every
description of personal question, and every miscellaneous
matter they could drag in, so as to prevent any progress
being made in the public business; and in this they have
completely succeeded, for never was there more noise and
violence, and less business done, than in this session.</p>

<p>In anticipation of Peel&rsquo;s resignation there are three
parties all animated with different hopes and desires&mdash;the
Grey party, the Melbourne, the Stanley. The first want Lord
Grey back with all the moderate Whigs, throwing over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Radicals; and leaving out the &lsquo;Dilly&rsquo; (as Stanley&rsquo;s party is
derisively called); in fact, Lord Grey would only come back
to carry the Irish question, which Stanley will be no party
to. The second want Melbourne and all his kit back again,
to go on with all the strength that the united force of Whigs
and Radicals amounts to. The third, expecting that Lord
Grey will decline to return without Stanley, desire that the
Radical Whigs should attempt it, with (as they think) the
certainty of failing, and then, that the urgency of the case
may bring about a coalition between Lord Grey, Peel, and
Stanley. Such a coalition would be very desirable in many
respects, but I much doubt Peel&rsquo;s ever consenting to take
office <i>under</i> Lord Grey (though with an equality of authority
and influence in the Government), and to lead a party from
which all his old friends, and those who look up to him with
unbounded devotion, must necessarily be excluded, and to
give up all pretensions to ascendency and domination in the
Cabinet.</p>

<h3>March 28th, 1835</h3>

<p>It appears now very doubtful whether Peel
will resign after a defeat on Monday; and I am disposed to believe
that it is not his intention; indeed, I never could understand
why he should. He has over and over again declared
that whenever the Opposition would bring forward a direct
motion against him, he should be prepared to resign, but not
till then. Still, I do not see how he can go on, and am much
inclined to think he ought not. Weak as he is, at the mercy
of this furious and reckless Opposition, Government suffers
in his hands; the Crown and all Executive authority suffer.
Every Government, to be useful and respectable, should have
the power of carrying its measures in its own way through
Parliament; but Peel cannot do this, and instead of quashing
any mischievous or untimely motion, he is compelled to submit
to one defeat after another upon matters which would
never have been stirred (or certainly not successfully) with
the late Government, or with any which possessed the confidence
of the House of Commons. It was expected that
Hume would persist in his motion for referring the Army
estimates to a committee, and that the Whigs would support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FRESH REVERSES.</span>
him; but when it came to the point, at the suggestion of
John Russell and Stanley, he very sulkily withdrew it; but
the night before, Government was beaten on two divisions, one
about the Leicester election, upon which all the lawyers in
the House were unanimous. But these opinions had no effect
upon the Radical majority, and they voted an address to the
Crown to confer a charter upon the London University, Lord
John Russell supporting it, although this question had been
argued before the Privy Council, which had still to report
upon it; and I believe that the general opinion of the Lords
was against conferring the charter in the present circumstances
of the university. Certainly, there was no discussion
in Council after the arguments were closed, but I gathered
that the impression was unfavourable to the grant of the
charter. The House of Commons knows nothing of the
argument, and rejected Goulburn&rsquo;s amendment to have the
proceedings before the Privy Council laid upon the table,
voting the address merely because Government opposed it.</p>

<h3>March 29th, 1835</h3>

<p>A meeting yesterday of Tories at Bridgewater
House for the purpose of securing a better attendance.
Twenty-nine Moderates met at the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Head,&rsquo; passengers
in the
&lsquo;Dilly;&rsquo;<a name="FNA_27_04" id="FNA_27_04"></a><a href="#FN_27_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
but of these, nine mean to vote with John
Russell, and one stays away; also, two or three others vote
against Stanley: queer partisans and <i>soi-disant</i> followers,
who oppose him on his own vital question. Peel concerted
with Stanley in the House on Friday, that the resolution
should be met with a negative. Wharncliffe was here to-day,
loud in his praises of the Duke of Wellington, and
delighted with the Cabinet of which he is a member, <i>jam
morituri</i> as they
are.<a name="FNA_27_05" id="FNA_27_05"></a><a href="#FN_27_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
He owned that they could not
<i>probably</i> go on, but that they would not give in till they
could show their friends that they had done all that men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
could or ought to do; so that they are resigned to their fate,
and only studying in what attitude they shall meet it.</p>

<h3>March 31st, 1835</h3>

<p>It is universally believed that Government
will go out after this debate. I think it very doubtful, but
the sooner they now go the better; they are well aware they
must retire, and the question is, whether they shall do so
immediately or wait till they have passed the Mutiny Bill.
If the House of Commons refused to pass the Mutiny Bill, I
think they would dissolve again. The King is in a dreadful
state of mind, as well he may be; however, it is all his own
doing, he had the courage, or rather rashness, to dismiss his
late Ministers, but I fear he has none of the cool and reflecting
resolution, and calm moral courage, which are necessary for
this crisis; he will again submit to whatever is dictated to him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the perplexity of the Opposition increases
as the moment of their triumph approaches. There
were 260 people at Lord John Russell&rsquo;s dinner, all prepared
to go any lengths, and 20 more who were absent put their
names down. O&rsquo;Connell, who declared &lsquo;it was the most
delightful evening he ever passed in his life,&rsquo; publicly acknowledged
John Russell as his leader, and the Radicals
were all present but Hume. Lord Auckland (who called
upon me about a house he is thinking of taking through my
mediation) said he would not do anything about it till this
week was over, as circumstances might render it unnecessary
for him to provide himself with a residence, but that he did
not see how anything permanent could come out of the
present state of things. He expected Ministers would resign,
that there would be audiences and negotiations, and that
at last they would come back again; that in the present state
of parties he saw not how any other Government could go
on any better than this; and when I asked him about John
Russell&rsquo;s dinner, he said it went off very well, but the composition
of it was <i>frightful</i> (or some such word, but not, I
think, quite so strong). John Russell and Melbourne, however,
are satisfied they can go on with the Radical assistance, and
they have gone too far now to throw these allies over; they
must and will make sacrifices to secure them for their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BAD POLICY OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
protection, and if the House of Lords is swamped in the first
instance, they will have things all their own way.</p>

<p>If it were not for the peril to all that is worth preserving,
I should not be sorry for anything that happened to the House
of Lords, to whose bigoted and senseless obstinacy (upheld and
directed I am sorry to say by the Duke and Lyndhurst) the
present miserable condition of affairs is mainly attributable.
Their rejection of the Tithe Bill last year was their crowning
exploit. After all their blunders and impotent struggles
against a stronger power, if they had passed that Bill, or
restored Stanley&rsquo;s in committee, and returned it to the
House of Commons, I believe everything might have been
retrieved. It has been remarked, and certainly with truth,
that Peel has never once endeavoured to excuse the House
of Lords or to vindicate the peers from the taunts and
reproaches which have repeatedly been thrown out against
them. In point of fact, I believe that the Lords either did
not consult him, or did not care for his opinion. There is
no disguising that the Lords liked nothing so well last year
as beating the Government, and exhibiting their puny and
spiteful power; now they are mightily shocked and disgusted
at the majority of the House of Commons taking their revenge,
though certainly the latter do it with much more
rage and factious violence, but with them it is a system
of tactics for a specific and attainable object. The Lords
really had no intelligible object but to embarrass a Government
they could not demolish, and gratify their own
spite. If the most violent Radical had been permitted to
chalk out the most suicidal course for the House of Lords to
follow, he could have devised nothing more ingenious and
well contrived than what they have actually done, taking
care to keep up their character in the nation for intolerance,
and inculcating a belief in their adherence to the most illiberal
maxims of foreign and domestic policy, instead of
devoting all their energies to the recovery of the ground they
had lost in popular estimation, and strengthening themselves
for the contest, which anybody might have seen was
not very remote.</p>

<h3>April 3rd, 1835</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
They divided at I know not what hour this
morning&mdash;321 to
289,<a name="FNA_27_06" id="FNA_27_06"></a><a href="#FN_27_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
a smaller majority than I was led to
expect when I heard that 18 or 19 of Stanley&rsquo;s (so-called)
party meant to go against him. Anybody who records from
day to day the shifting appearances of the political sky must
constantly recant one day the opinion and expectation of the
preceding. Stanley&rsquo;s speech the night before last may very
likely make an important difference in the result of this
extraordinary contest, for he has, as it seems to me, put a
final end to any possibility of junction with the great body
of the Whigs now arrayed under John Russell; he attacked
Lord John himself&mdash;his Whig and Radical alliance and the
inconsistency of his present conduct&mdash;with the utmost vehemence
and scornful reprobation, and he poured forth a torrent
of sarcasm and ridicule upon the prospective Government that
he concludes they meditate. This is so conclusive that it
paves the way to his junction with Peel, or if the latter goes
out and John Russell does come in, it is clear that he will
have both Peel and Stanley in opposition to him, against
whom in the nearly balanced state of parties he could not
struggle on for a month. He was miserably feeble in this
debate (in his opening speech), and though he may just do
to lead an Opposition which wants no leading, and merely
sticks him up as a nominal chief, he could no more lead a
Government in the House of Commons than he could command
an army in the field. [So much for my prediction. Stanley&rsquo;s
followers dropped off and left him alone, the Government had
no difficulty, and John Russell proved a very good leader.&mdash;<i>January
1837</i>.] Whatever may be the fate of Government for
the present, I believe it to be impossible that anything can
prevent Peel&rsquo;s speedy return to office; he has raised his
reputation to such a height during this session, he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE IRISH CHURCH QUESTION.</span>
established such a conviction of his great capacity and of
his liberal, enlarged, and at the same time safe views and
opinions, that even the Radicals, such as Hume, join in the
general chorus of admiration which is raised to his merits;
he stands so proudly eminent, and there is such a general
lack of talent, that he must be recalled by the voice of the
nation and by the universal admission that he is indispensable
to the country.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_27_06" id="FN_27_06"></a><a href="#FNA_27_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[On the 30th of March Lord John Russell moved the resolution
which was carried by this division; the terms of it were, &lsquo;That this House
resolve itself into a committee of the whole House, in order to consider
the present state of the Church Establishment in Ireland, with the view of
applying any surplus of the revenues not required for the spiritual care of
its members to the general education of all classes of the people, without
distinction of religious persuasion.&rsquo;]</p></div>

<p>I am much inclined to think that this debate on the
Irish Church question will eventually damage the Whigs
not a little. Their speeches this year might all have been
answered by their speeches last year on the same subject, and
nothing can be so glaring as their inconsistency and the
factiousness of their motives. The question is not a popular
one in the country, where nothing like favour to the Catholics
of Ireland or their religion is agreeable to the mass. The
arguments in the debate have been triumphantly in favour
of the Government <i>upon the resolution</i> as contradistinguished
from the principle; for though I am decidedly favourable to
the principle, and never had a doubt that it is preposterous
to contend that if there is a reform of the Church, and
there turns out to be a surplus, such surplus should not be
dealt with as Parliament in its wisdom shall deem best for
the general interests, under the actual circumstances of the
country, at the time the appropriation takes place; still it
is perfectly consistent with that opinion to refuse to vote for
the appropriation of the surplus which may never exist at
all, or only exist at some distant period, when other circumstances
may render the proposed appropriation altogether
inexpedient.</p>

<p><i>In the afternoon</i>.&mdash;Peel&rsquo;s speech was not so good as usual;
it was laboured, and some say tame. In the morning I met
him and walked with him; he seemed in very good spirits,
talked of the thing as over, said he could not endure any
meddling with the Tithe Bill, that he considered great good
had been done by the dissolution, which had created a party
strong enough to obstruct any violent measures on the part
of their opponents, said he understood they had sent for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Lord Spencer did not believe Lord Grey would have any
concern with it. I said that it was clear after Stanley&rsquo;s
speech that <i>he</i> would have nothing to do with the Whigs.
He said he conceived so, but that it was very odd that Lord
John Russell did not see it in that light, and had said
that Graham could not join them, but he did not see
why Stanley might not. I told Peel that in my opinion
the best thing that had been done was the proof that he
had been enabled to exhibit that he was indispensable
to the government of the country, and that if he could
infuse some firmness and courage into the King, and
persuade His Majesty stoutly to resist any requisition to
swamp the House of Lords, and rather to appeal to the
country than consent to it, in a very short space of time he
must come back. I asked him if he thought the King was
capable of any such firmness. He said he thought he was,
that he was in a miserable state of mind at the prospect before
him, and all the more so from feeling how much there was in
it which fell personally upon himself. In the meantime it
does not seem that the Ministers have come to any positive
resolution, or even conviction, as to the moment of their retirement,
nor as to its absolute, unavoidable necessity. Peel
evidently considers the contest at an end. Lord Rosslyn this
morning thought he would resign immediately; the Duke, on
the other hand, appears by no means so certain that the
Tithe Bill will be mutilated, and that they shall be compelled
to go out at all. Stanley and Graham are angry that
they don&rsquo;t resign directly; they think Peel would retire more
brilliantly at once than by waiting for more defeats. They
forget that he is bound to satisfy his own party. Stanley,
with that levity which distinguishes all his conduct, talks of
him as of &lsquo;a hunted fox, who, instead of dying gallantly
before the hounds in the open, skulks along the hedgerows,
and at last turns up his legs in a ditch.&rsquo; This he said to George
Bentinck, who told it to me; it is not the way that Lord
Stanley ought to speak of Sir Robert Peel. What I certainly
do regret is that he condescended repeatedly to entreat John
Russell to put off bringing up the report till Monday, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR R. PEEL&rsquo;S RETIREMENT.</span>
exposed himself to a refusal. He should have invited the
decision of the contest rather than have tried to protract it.</p>

<h3>April 4th, 1835</h3>

<p>I told Jonathan Peel last night that Stanley
and Graham blamed Sir Robert for not resigning at once.
He said that Sir Robert would, as far as his own feelings
were concerned, have preferred resigning long ago, but that
a vast number of his supporters were furious at the idea of
his resigning at all, and wanted him to persist at all hazards,
and he was compelled to resign only upon such a point as
might enable him to satisfy them that he had abided by the
pledge which he gave at the beginning to persevere while
perseverance could be useful or honourable. He then told
me (which I certainly did not attach the slightest credit
to<a name="FNA_27_07" id="FNA_27_07"></a><a href="#FN_27_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>)
that he should not be at all surprised if his brother were
now to retire from public life. Such an idea in some
moment of disgust may have crossed his mind, but if he
were to do so in the vigour of his age and at the climax of
his reputation, it would be the most extraordinary retirement
that history ever recorded. Men of the most splendid
talents have often shrunk from entering public life, but I
am not aware of any instance of a man who had attained
the eminence and the fame of Peel who has withdrawn
from the theatre of his glory and power without some
stronger motive than any that can be found for him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_27_07" id="FN_27_07"></a><a href="#FNA_27_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
A great fool indeed I should have been if I had.&mdash;1838.</p></div>

<p>I was told last night that the scene of noise and uproar
which the House of Commons now exhibits is perfectly disgusting.
This used not to be the case in better, or at least
more gentlemanlike, times; no noises were permissible but
the cheer and the cough, the former admitting every variety
of intonation expressive of admiration, approbation, assent,
denial, surprise, indignation, menace, sarcasm. Now all the
musical skill of this instrument is lost and drowned in shouts,
hootings, groans, noises the most discordant that the human
throat can emit, sticks and feet beating against the floor.
Sir Hedworth Williamson, a violent Whig, told me that
there were a set of fellows on his side of the House whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
regular practice it was to make this uproar, and with the
settled design to bellow Peel down. This is the <i>reformed</i>
House of Commons. Peel told Lord Ashley the other day that
he did not think it possible for the same man to be Prime
Minister and leader in the House of Commons (he meant to
be First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer),
that no physical strength was adequate to the
labour of both employments. He may therefore hereafter
put some Peer at the head of the Government, but it is
equally indispensable, as it seems to me, that the real substantial
power should be vested in the leader of the House
of Commons, especially when he is a man so superior as
Peel must always be to any colleagues he may be associated
with.</p>

<h3>April 5th, 1835</h3>

<p>I understand now what Jonathan Peel
meant by talking of the possibility of his brother&rsquo;s retiring
from public life. He is no doubt thoroughly, heartily disgusted
with his own associates. It appears that they (the
Tories, or many of them) are indignant at his declaration
the other night that on the Tithe Bill being altered he
would go out, so that while others are blaming him for not
going out at once his own followers are enraged that he will
not set the House of Commons at defiance and stick to his
post. It is very evident that many of them are desirous (if
Peel does resign) of continuing the fight under the Duke of
Wellington, if they could prevail on him to try it, and to
dissolve Parliament and get up a &lsquo;No Popery&rsquo; cry. They
say that &lsquo;the country&rsquo; (by which they mean their own
faction) looks up to the Duke, and that Peel has really no
interest there. The fact is that they cannot forgive him
for his Liberal principles and Liberal measures, and probably
they never believed that he was sincere in the professions he
made, or that he really intended to introduce such measures
as he has done. They feel (not without reason) that they
cannot follow him in the broad path he has entered upon
without abandoning all their long-cherished maxims of exclusion
and ascendency, and that in so doing they would
incur much odium and disgrace. Peel sees and knows all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR R. PEEL AND THE TORIES.</span>
this, and cannot fail to perceive that he is not the Minister
for them and they no longer the party for him. It is no
wonder that he is anxious to break up this unmanageable
force, and he probably would rather trust to that increasing
feeling and opinion about himself, which is so apparent
among all classes of politicians, to place him by-and-by at
the head of a party formed upon Conservative principles
and embracing a much wider circle of opinions. Still this
Tory body, obstinate and bigoted as they are, have no other
chief, and can find none, and it is essential to Peel to keep
them if possible under his influence and direction, and therefore
(I believe very reluctantly) he defers his resignation.</p>

<h3>April 6th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday Wharncliffe came here; very low
indeed; he says he never thought they were safe, though he
owns that he was surprised and disappointed that there were
no defections&mdash;not one&mdash;from the enemies&rsquo; ranks when these
measures were brought forward. He says he was with the
King the other evening, and asked him if he was going back
to Windsor. His Majesty said &lsquo;he could not go back, that he
could not bear being there; there he had none of them (his
Ministers) to talk to, and day and night his mind was absorbed
in public affairs.&rsquo; Poor wretch! he suffers martyrdom,
and has more to suffer yet, for I expect they will have no
mercy on him. Yesterday I had more proofs of the animus
of the Tories. One of them, a foolish, hot-brained fellow
certainly (but there is no such enormous difference between
the best and the worst), told me that if Peel really did go
out upon the Tithe Bill he would abandon his party; that
he ought to let them alter the Bill as they pleased, wait
till the House of Commons threw it out, and then dissolve
Parliament.</p>

<h3>April 7th, 1835</h3>

<p>Each day elicits some new proof of what I
have written above&mdash;the totally altered feelings and expressions
of all conditions of politicians about Sir Robert Peel.
It would seem as if his friends were suddenly converted into
his enemies, and his enemies into his friends. The Tories still
cling to the expectation that he will hold on to office; they
say that if he goes out he abandons his party, abandons the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
King. They call to mind Pitt in 1784. &lsquo;Very slippery,&rsquo; said
one to me yesterday, when I read to him Peel&rsquo;s answer to the
City address. On the other hand Mulgrave was last night enthusiastic
in his praise; he owned that he had done admirably&mdash;given
proof of his perfect sincerity and acted in accordance
with all his declarations and professions. &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;astonished; nothing in Peel&rsquo;s past political career led me to
expect that he would have done so admirably as he has.
He has raised himself immensely in my opinion.&rsquo; Such is
the language of them all, swelling a choral note of praise;
and then, to make the whole thing more ridiculous (if anything
so serious can be ridiculous), the Tories, who abuse
him lustily, are moving heaven and earth to retain him, by
violence almost, in his place; while the Whigs and Radicals,
who laud him to the skies, are striving with might and main
to turn him out. In a state of profound tranquillity these
Ministers are quietly transacting business with a perfect
consciousness and an universal understanding that their
Government is at an end, and the Opposition are redoubling
their blows in the House of Commons, and waiting in the
complete certainty of returning to office, for which they are
already making all their arrangements. The parts are all
so quietly performed, the catastrophe is so clearly before
everybody&rsquo;s eyes and understanding, that it more resembles
a dramatic representation than a mighty event in real life,
big perhaps with incalculable consequences.</p>

<h3>April 8th, 1835</h3>

<p>There was a majority of twenty-seven last
night, which I conclude settles the
business.<a name="FNA_27_08" id="FNA_27_08"></a><a href="#FN_27_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
There was to
be a Cabinet this morning at eleven, at which they had
resolved to agree upon their resignations. Wharncliffe saw
the King last night. He is very composed; they think
they can infuse courage and firmness into him, but when he
is left to himself, I doubt him. Nothing can be imagined
more painful on both sides than his approaching interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEFEAT OF SIR R. PEEL&rsquo;S MINISTRY.</span>
with the once rejected and now triumphant Whigs. Yesterday
I rode with Ellice up the Park. He said, &lsquo;Grey will do
anything they wish him to do, but I think he had better
have nothing to do with it.&rsquo; He talked of the new Government
that will be formed as having no difficulty; that they
might have if Peel and the Tories went into violent opposition,
which he is convinced Peel will not do. I said they
might go on till the Tithe Bill went to the House of Lords,
when they would expunge the appropriation clause. He
said, &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t be so mad; there is no Church of Ireland
now, and the question is whether there shall be one, for
without that clause no Tithe Bill will ever pass.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>April 9th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday the Ministers resigned. Peel announced
it to the House of Commons in a short but admirable
speech by all accounts, exactly suitable to the occasion,
and to his principal object&mdash;that of setting himself right with
his own supporters, who begin to acquiesce, though rather
sulkily, in the course he has pursued. Lord Grey is to be
with the King this morning. He was riding quietly in the
Park yesterday afternoon, and neither knew nor cared (apparently)
whether he had been sent for or not. His daughter
told me (for I rode with them up Constitution Hill) that his
family could not wish him to return to office, but would not
interfere. She then talked, much to my surprise, of the possibility
of a junction between him and Peel; she owned that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR JAMES GRAHAM ON PEEL AND STANLEY.</span>
Peel had done wonders, but said that she could not wish for
such a junction <i>now</i>, however it might be possible and desirable
that it should take place some little time hence. This shows
a very Conservative spirit and a marvellous thaw in the rigidity
of the Grey politics.</p>

<p>In the morning I went to Graham to ask him to advocate
my cause in the Sinecure Committee and defend my
interests there. After talking over my case (about which
he was very obliging and promised his zealous assistance)
we discussed general politics at great length. It is very
evident that he and Stanley have no leaning towards the
Whigs, and look <i>now</i> solely to a junction with Peel and the
construction of a Liberal and Conservative party and Government.
He talked of this, and of the mode of accomplishing
it, with as much zeal and fervour as if he had been a member
of the Cabinet which has just fallen, and I think his opinions
coincide very much with my own. He wants the King to be
well <i>endoctriné</i>, and that his firmness (if he has any) should
be directed to one or two points, and his mind not puzzled
with complicated instructions. He should be advised never
to admit O&rsquo;Connell to any office, and to resist a creation
of Peers. He thinks, if his Majesty is stout on these points,
that things will come round, and he by no means despairs of
the feeling and animus of the country. I told him the Tories
and late Government people still contended that if he and
Stanley had joined the thing would have gone on, which he vehemently
denied, and declared that they could not have saved
Peel and should have entirely compromised themselves; he
talked with great admiration of Peel, and of the reception he
had met with from him in the interview they had on his return,
which he said was cordial and obliging to the greatest degree,
and without any appearance of that coldness and reserve of
which he has been so often accused. He then talked of Stanley
with great openness&mdash;of his talents, character, and political
views. I told him that Stanley had not raised himself this
session, that he had given much offence by the general levity
of his conduct, and especially to the Tories by the occasional
flippancy or severity of his attacks upon them, that as it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
clear that any Conservative Government must depend upon
the great body of the Tory party for support, it was improvident
in him to make himself obnoxious to them, and that
he would do well to exert his influence over Stanley for the
purpose of restraining those sallies in which he was too apt
to indulge, and showing him the expediency of conciliating
that not very wise but still powerful body. He asked in
what way Stanley had offended. I told him generally in the
sarcastic or reprobating tone he had used, and particularly
in his personal attack on the Duke for holding the offices.
He owned there was truth in this, &lsquo;but what could you do?
it was impossible to change a man&rsquo;s character, and Stanley&rsquo;s
was very peculiar. With great talents, extraordinary
readiness in debate, high principles, unblemished honour, he
never had looked, he thought he never would look, upon
politics and political life with the seriousness which belonged
to the subject; he followed politics as an amusement, as
a means of excitement, as another would gaming or any
other very excitable occupation; he plunged into the <i>mêlée</i>
for the sake of the sport which he found it made there,
but always actuated by honourable and consistent principles
and feelings, and though making it a matter of diversion
and amusement, never sacrificing anything that honour or
conscience prescribed.&rsquo; I said that this description of him
(which I had no doubt was true) only proved what I already
thought&mdash;that, with all his talents, he never would be a great
man. He said he always must be very considerable; his
powers, integrity, birth, and fortune could not fail to raise
him to eminence. All this I admitted&mdash;that nothing could
prevent his being very considerable, very important, as a public
man&mdash;but I argued that one who was animated by motives so
personal, and so wanting in gravity, to whom public care
was a subsidiary and not a primary object, never could
achieve permanent and genuine greatness. He said that
Stanley had a great admiration for Peel, without any tincture
of jealousy, and that he was quite ready to serve under him,
though he could not help doubting whether it would be
possible for two such men, so different in character, to go on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISTRESS OF THE KING.</span>
well together in the same Cabinet. I told him what Wharncliffe
had told me, that no man was ever more easy to act with,
more candid and conciliatory, and less assuming than Peel
in the Cabinet, and Graham said that Stanley was likewise
perfect as a colleague, so that it may be hoped there would
not be any such incompatibility if they were to come together.
I was with him two hours and a half, and we discussed very
fully all political contingencies with the freedom of twenty
years ago, when we were great friends.</p>

<h3>April 10th, 1835</h3>

<p>Nothing decisive yesterday. Lord Grey
was with the King in the morning; he there met Lord Melbourne,
Lord Holland, Lord John Russell, and Lord Lansdowne,
and went back to St. James&rsquo;s. It was said in the
evening that Lord Grey was to assist in the formation of the
Government, but not to take office himself.</p>

<h3>April 11th, 1835</h3>

<p>The intention of Lord Grey evidently was
to avoid office if he could, but if strongly urged by the King,
and his feelings appealed to, to yield. The King, however,
did not urge him at all, probably much to his astonishment,
but assuming apparently that he would under no circumstances
return to office, consulted him as to the course he
should adopt. All my information as to what has hitherto
taken place amounts to this:&mdash;His Majesty has been in a
very composed state of mind, has received the Whig leaders
in a way that has given them complete satisfaction, and as
far as personal intercourse goes the embarrassment appears
to be removed. He has given Melbourne <i>carte blanche</i> to
form a Government, and he is proceeding in the task. Notwithstanding
the good face which the King contrives to put
upon the matter in his communications with his hated new-old
Ministers and masters, he is really very miserable, and
the Duchess of Gloucester, to whom he unbosoms himself
more than to anybody, told Lady Georgiana Bathurst that
with her he was in the most pitiable state of distress, constantly
in tears, and saying that &lsquo;he felt his crown tottering
on his head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It is intended to leave O&rsquo;Connell out of the arrangement,
and at the same time to conciliate him and preserve his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
support. In this they have apparently succeeded. O&rsquo;Connell
&lsquo;has behaved admirably well,&rsquo; and the difficulty with
regard to him is at an end. Of the Radicals some are to be
included and no notice taken of the rest. Brougham is to be
set at defiance; his fall in public estimation, his manifold
sins against his own colleagues, and his loss of character all
justify them, and enable them (as they think) to do so with
impunity. Melbourne, who when
Lamb<a name="FNA_28_01" id="FNA_28_01"></a><a href="#FN_28_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
is here is greatly
influenced by him, is strongly against any Radical measures
or Radical colleagues, and has no thought of a creation of
Peers or of any desperate expedients, and he is not at all
satisfied with the resolution which John carried, and which
was the immediate cause of Peel&rsquo;s resignation, being fully
alive to all the inconvenience of it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_28_01" id="FN_28_01"></a><a href="#FNA_28_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[Meaning Sir Frederick Lamb, his brother, usually residing abroad in
the diplomatic service.]</p></div>

<p>Just now Tavistock was here, having come from St.
George&rsquo;s Church, where he went to assist at Lord John
Russell&rsquo;s marriage, and as the ceremony could not begin for
half an hour, he came over to pass the interval with
me.<a name="FNA_28_02" id="FNA_28_02"></a><a href="#FN_28_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
He told me that &lsquo;there still existed <i>one</i> difficulty, one only,
which I should not think of, apparently unimportant, but
which circumstances rendered important, and if this was got
over, the Government would be formed and go on, that he
thought it was an <i>even bet</i> whether it was got over or not.
What this difficulty is, so little obvious, but so important, I
do not guess; but in such affairs <i>one</i> difficulty will not stand
in the way of completing an arrangement the consummation
of which has cost such incredible exertions, and such sacrifices
of consistency and of public interests to the interests
or ambition of a party.</p>

[Lord John Russell married, in April 1835, Theresa, widow of Lord
Ribblesdale.    Mr. Greville lived at this time on the north side of Hanover
Square.]</p></div>

<h3>April 12th, 1835</h3>

<p>Nothing settled yesterday, and great doubts
if anything would be. Lord John was married in the morning;
he returned to Kent House with his bride, and Melbourne
was to have sent him word at <i>one</i> what was definitively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR R. PEEL&rsquo;S MINISTRY.</span>
settled; he waited till two, when no news arriving from
Melbourne, he went off to Woburn. He was at that time
by no means sanguine as to the arrangements being completed,
and talked in doubt of the Foreign Office, to which
he is to go. However, Melbourne was to be with the King
this morning to announce that the Ministry would or would
not do. Sefton told me last night that the <i>difficulty</i> proceeds
from Spring Rice; if it should fail (which it will not, I
expect) Peel must stay in and take in the Dilly, who would
not then scruple to join him. The Government would be
formed upon the <i>principle</i> of not settling this eternal Irish
Church question, which I think so great an evil that it is on
the whole better that Melbourne should form a Government
and go on as long as he can&mdash;that is, till something decisive
is done about the Irish Church. I met the whole Dilly at
dinner yesterday at Stafford House, and when I told Stanley
and Graham that I understood Spring Rice made the difficulty,
they both said that it must be what they called &lsquo;his
conundrum,&rsquo; which I had never heard of before; but it
means his determination to apply the surplus to the purposes
of <i>general education</i>, but not to go a jot further, and they
suppose that this is not far enough for the others, and hence
the difficulty.</p>

<h3>April 13th, 1835</h3>

<p>Nothing positively known yesterday, but
that the thing is settled in some way, Clusterings and
congregations of Whigs about Brookes&rsquo;, audiences with the
King, and great doubt whether Grey took office, and the
Foreign Office.</p>

<h3>April 14th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday it was understood that everything
was settled, but after all it was only the night before last
that Melbourne was definitively charged with the formation
of a Government. The difficulties were O&rsquo;Connell and
Spring Rice; the former was got over by his waiving all
claim to employment and promising his gratuitous support.
By what underhand management or persuasion, and what
secret understanding, this was effected will be a mystery for
the present, but nobody doubts that it has been accomplished
by some juggle. Spring Rice wanted to wash his hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the concern; he did not think it promised sufficient stability,
and without some assurance of its lasting he wished to decline
taking office. They would not hear this, and represented
to him that he was indispensable, and it ended in his
giving way. It certainly would have been very unjustifiable
of him, after going all lengths with them, to hold back at
last, but it shows the opinion of the best men among them
of the rottenness of the concern. Lord Grey declined taking
office, but wrote to say that the Government should have all
his support, and that he wished Howick to be included in it,
which is the same thing as if he were there himself. Nothing
was settled about the cast of offices, and they were waiting
for Lord John&rsquo;s arrival from Woburn to discuss that matter.
Between the pretensions of one man, the reluctance of
another, and the hymeneal occupation of the leader the
matter hobbled on very slowly. I certainly never remember
a great victory for which Te Deum was chanted with so
faint and joyless a voice. Peel looks gayer and easier than
all Brookes&rsquo; put together, and Lady Holland said, &lsquo;Now that
we have gained our object I am not so glad as I thought I
should be,&rsquo; and that I take to be the sentiment of them all.</p>

<h3>Riddlesworth, April 16th, 1835</h3>

<p>At Newmarket the day before
yesterday, and came here to-day, where I find the Duke and
Duchess of Cleveland and two or three others. I know nothing
but by my letters from London, by which I learn that nothing is
yet settled, but they go on negotiating and endeavouring
to arrange their rickety concern. Having concluded their
bargain with O&rsquo;Connell, they have taken fright about
Brougham, and degraded as he is, and contemptuous and
confident as they were about him, they are endeavouring to
make terms with him, and it will probably end in his
recovering the Great Seal. When this is done they will
have consummated their disgrace. Sheil said, &lsquo;The difficulty
is how to deal with a bully and a buffoon,&rsquo; and as
they have succumbed to and bargained with the one, now
they are going to truckle to the other; there is not one of
them who has scrupled to express his opinion of Brougham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE NEW WHIG CABINET.</span>
but let us see if he really does come in or much indignation
may be thrown away. The general opinion (I am told) is
that this Ministry will last a very short time and that
ultimately a coalition must take place under the direction
and supremacy of Sir Robert Peel. This is jumping to a conclusion
over many difficulties. However, nothing can be more
meagre than the triumph of the Whigs nor more humiliating
than their position; even my Whig-Radical friends write
me word that &lsquo;O&rsquo;Connell holds the destiny of the Government
in his hands, and is acknowledged to be the greatest
man going.&rsquo; It was hardly worth while (in a national point
of view, whatever it may have been in a party one) to turn
out Sir Robert Peel in order to produce this result.</p>

<h3>Buckenham, April 29th, 1835</h3>

<p>At Newmarket all last week,
here since Monday. I know nothing of politics but from
newspapers and my letters; racing and hawking are my
present occupations. There seems to be an impression that
the present Government will not last very long, but as the
grounds of that opinion are the badness of its composition,
I do not see that its speedy dissolution is so certain; the
public seems to have got very indifferent as to who governs
the country. I was curious to hear how the Council went
off at which the Ministers took their seats, and how the
King comported himself. He seems to have got through it
tolerably, though it must have been a bitter ceremony to
him. He made no speeches and took no particular notice of
anybody except Lord Howick, to whom he was very civil, on
account probably of his father, and because he is a new man.
The threatened contests of most of them ended in smoke.
Devonshire and Yorkshire will, however, be important and
severe. Of all the appointments those that are most
severely criticised are Mulgrave&rsquo;s and Morpeth&rsquo;s. It is said
that Charles Kemble and Liston might as well have been
sent, as the former has always imitated the one, and the
latter involuntarily resembles the other. Mulgrave, however
he may be sneered at, has been tried and found capable,
and I think he will do very well; he has courage and firmness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and no want of ability. He is besides hospitable,
generous, courteous, and agreeable in private
life.<a name="FNA_28_03" id="FNA_28_03"></a><a href="#FN_28_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Morpeth made an excellent speech on introducing
his Irish Tithe Bill, and has raised himself considerably.
Morpeth is (as it appears to me) ill selected for the
difficult post he occupies; he has very fair ability of a
showy kind, but I doubt the solidity and strength of his
material for the rough work which is allotted to him.</p>

<p>The last day of Parliament was distinguished by a worse
attack of O&rsquo;Connell upon Alvanley for what he had said the
day before in the House of Lords. Alvanley has sent him a
message through Dawson Damer demanding an apology or
satisfaction, and the result I don&rsquo;t yet
know.<a name="FNA_28_04" id="FNA_28_04"></a><a href="#FN_28_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

which was accepted and the duel took place.]</p></div>

<h3>London, May 17th, 1835</h3>

<p>Newmarket and gout have between
them produced an interval of unusual length in my scribblings,
though I am not aware of having had anything
particularly interesting to record. We had Stanley at Newmarket
the second week as well as the first, taking a lively
interest in John Russell&rsquo;s defeat in Devonshire. This defeat
was a great mortification to his party, and was not compensated
by the easy victory which Morpeth obtained in
Yorkshire. These elections and the affair between Alvanley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD ALVANLEY&rsquo;S DUEL.</span>
and O&rsquo;Connell have been the chief objects of attention; all
the newspapers are full of details, which I need not put
down here. Alvanley seems to have behaved with great
spirit and resolution. There was a meeting at De Ros&rsquo;s
house of De Ros, Damer, Lord Worcester, and Duncombe to
consider what was to be done on the receipt of Morgan
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s letter, and whether Alvanley should fight him
or not. Worcester and Duncombe were against fighting,
the other two for it. Alvanley at once said that the boldest
course was the best, and he would go out. It was agreed
that no time should be lost, so Damer was despatched to
Colonel Hodges, and said Alvanley was ready to meet
Morgan O&rsquo;Connell. &lsquo;The next morning,&rsquo; Hodges suggested.
&lsquo;No, immediately.&rsquo; The parties joined in Arlington Street
and went off in two hackney coaches; Duncombe, Worcester,
and De Ros, with Dr. Hume, in a third. Only Hume went on
the ground, for Damer had objected to the presence of some
Irish friend of O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s, so that Alvanley&rsquo;s friends could
only look on from a distance. The only other persons who
came near them were an old Irishwoman and a Methodist
parson, the latter of whom exhorted the combatants in vain
to forego their sinful purpose, and to whom Alvanley replied,
&lsquo;Pray, sir, go and mind your own affairs, for I have enough
to do now to think of mine.&rsquo; &lsquo;Think of your soul,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Alvanley, &lsquo;but my body is now in the greatest
danger.&rsquo; The Irishwoman would come and see the fighting,
and asked for some money for her attendance. Damer
seems to have been a very bad second, and probably lost his
head; he ought not to have consented to the third shots
upon any account. Alvanley says he execrated him in his
heart when he found he had consented to it. Hodges acted
like a ruffian, and had anything happened he would have
been hanged. It is impossible to know whether the first
shot was fired by mistake or not. The impression on the
minds of Alvanley&rsquo;s friends is that it was <i>not</i>, but it is difficult
to believe that any man would endeavour to take such
an advantage. However, no shot ought to have been fired
after that. The affair made an amazing noise. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
O&rsquo;Connell had threatened to mention it in the House of
Commons, Damer went to Peel to put him in possession of
all the circumstances, but he said that he was sure O&rsquo;Connell
would not venture to stir the matter there.</p>

<p>Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s resignation of the White Wand has set
conjecture afloat as to his motives, and it is asserted on one
side, but denied on the other, that disgust at O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s
predominance is the reason, following disappointment at not
having been himself reinstated. I do not know the truth of
the matter. Lord John Russell takes his seat on Monday, after
which business will begin again in earnest in the House of
Commons. There is an impression that this Government
will not be of long continuance, and that the Ministers are
themselves aware that their tenure of office must be brief.
They will at all events get through this session, for much
remains to be done in the way of approximation and combination
between different sections of public men before any
satisfactory arrangement can be made for replacing the
present Ministers. If it was not for the Irish question, and
the apparent impossibility of bringing that to any final
adjustment, I should not despair of the introduction of a
better state of feeling and the mitigation of the bitterness
and animosity which set men of different parties so irreconcilably
against each other. At present there is certainly a
great calm after the storm which raged so fiercely a little
while ago. I have been so out of the world between Newmarket
and the gout that I know but little of what has been
passing, and merely throw in this brief notice to keep up the
chain of my observations and remarks.</p>

<h3>May 24th, 1835</h3>

<p>Came from Newmarket on Thursday night.
Melbourne is said (by his friends) to be doing very well in
the House of Lords, but the discussion on Friday about
Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s resignation gave him great annoyance.
Lord Wellesley declined to say why he had resigned, and
merely declared it was not on account of Mulgrave&rsquo;s procession,
but he did not contradict any one of the assertions
that the cause was disgust at O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s ascendency. When
Lord Harrowby said that &lsquo;if he had been Mulgrave he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE APPEAL OF SWIFT <i>v.</i> KELLY.</span>
would rather have been torn in pieces than have marched
in under such banners as were displayed,&rsquo; Lord Wellesley
loudly cheered him. Peel&rsquo;s speech at the dinner the
other day has made a great deal of noise, for he is supposed
to have thrown over his High Tory friends very completely
in it, and to have exhibited a determination to adapt
his opinions and conduct to the spirit of the times. However,
the Tories affect to be satisfied, laud it to the skies,
and distribute it through the country. In the House of
Commons up to this time nothing has been done; Peel has
made over his Dissenters Bill to the Government, who will
probably do nothing with it this session. Nobody expects
the present Administration to last long, as it is said, not
even themselves; but nothing is prepared for the formation
of a better and more durable Cabinet.</p>

<p>Lord Eliot<a name="FNA_28_05" id="FNA_28_05"></a><a href="#FN_28_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and Colonel Gurwood have returned from
Spain, satisfied that the Carlist party cannot be put down, and
having had a conversation with Louis Philippe, the substance
of which appeared in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and very correctly. Great
indignation is expressed at the indiscretion which let this out,
and it is understood that Gurwood has been chattering about
what passed in all directions. The King of France, it is
clear, will not interfere, and so they must fight it out.
Spanish stock fell 15 per cent, in one or two days. The
King is in such a state of dudgeon that he will not give any
dinners to anybody.</p>

[Lord Eliot (afterwards Earl of St. Germans) had been sent to Spain
by the Duke of Wellington, in March 1835, to endeavour to mitigate the
atrocities which at that time disgraced the leaders on both sides in the civil
contest raging in Spain. He was eminently successful in his mission, and a
Convention (commonly known as the Convention of Bergara) was signed
under his Lordship&rsquo;s mediation at Logroño on the 27th of April, 1835. A
narrative of this mission was printed by Lord St. Germans in 1871.]</p></div>

<p>Yesterday Swift and
Kelly&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_28_06" id="FNA_28_06"></a><a href="#FN_28_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
case came on before the
Privy Council. It was to have been heard the Monday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
before, when it would have been argued and decided, because
every day in the week was disposable for the purpose, but
Brougham thought fit to interfere. He insisted upon being
there to hear it, and compelled Lord Lansdowne to put off
the hearing till Saturday, to the extraordinary inconvenience
of all parties. On Saturday the court met, but no Brougham.
They began, and in about two hours he made his appearance,
read his letters, wrote notes, corrected some paper (for the
press, as I could see), and now and then attended to the
cause, making flippant observations, much to the terror of
Jervaise&mdash;Miss Kelly&rsquo;s uncle&mdash;for all his interruptions appeared
to be directed adversely to them. I told Mr. Jervaise
he need not pay any attention to what Brougham said. As
he came late, so he went away early, breaking up the court
at half-past three, and as other engagements occupied the
Judges the rest of the week, it was put off till the 18th of
June.</p>

in Rome, and their adventures are related in a former part of these Journals,

<h3>May 30th, 1835</h3>

<p>On Wednesday last went to Charles Kemble&rsquo;s
in the evening; singing and playing; Mrs. Arkwright, Miss
Strutt, old Liverati (horrible squabbling), and Miss Adelaide
Kemble. The father and mother both occupied with their
daughter&rsquo;s book, which Kemble told me he had &lsquo;never read
till it appeared in print, and was full of sublime things and
vulgarities,&rsquo; and the mother &lsquo;was divided between admiration
and disgust, threw it down six times, and as often picked
it up.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>Thursday night.</h3>

<p>To Horace Twiss&rsquo;s what he called &lsquo;a
Judy party&rsquo;&mdash;a supper and jollification, where all were
expected to contribute to the amusement of the company
who possessed wherewithal. The contributors were Twiss
himself, Mrs. Arkwright, Miss Cooke, Dance, Miss Dance,
Planché, Mrs. Blood, Mrs. Groom, Theodore Hook, Billy
something, who imitated Cooper and Ward. I stayed till
two, and they went on till three. It was sufficiently amusing
altogether, though noisy and vulgar; company very miscellaneous,
but everybody ready to amuse and be amused.</p>

<h3>Friday.</h3>

<p>The Committee of Council met on the matter of
the London University; Brougham of course the great performer;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LONDON UNIVERSITY CHARTER.</span>
the same persons were summoned who had attended
before, but great changes had since taken place, which made
the assembly curious. There were Melbourne, Lord Lansdowne
and certain of his colleagues, Brougham and Lyndhurst&mdash;both
ex-Chancellors since the last meeting&mdash;Richmond,
Ripon, Stanley and Graham, the Dilly complete, and Lord
Grey. When they came to discuss the matter nobody seemed
disposed to move; at last Brougham proposed a resolution
&lsquo;that the King should be advised to grant a charter making
the petitioners an University, the regulations and restrictions
to be determined hereafter.&rsquo; The Bishop of London objected
on behalf of King&rsquo;s College to any advantages being conferred
on the London University which would place the latter
institution in a better condition than the former. After
much tedious discussion the words &lsquo;university,&rsquo; &amp;c., were
omitted, and the resolution moved was &lsquo;<i>to grant a charter</i>.&rsquo;
The Duke of Richmond formally opposed it, his principal
objection being to the insolvent state of the concern.
Brougham sat in contemptuous silence for a few minutes
while the Duke spoke, and then replied. There was a
squabble between them, and an evident inclination on the
part of the majority present to refuse the charter, but the
address of the Commons with the King&rsquo;s answer were read,
which presented a very difficult case to act upon. The
King&rsquo;s answer amounted very nearly to an engagement to
grant a charter; the Privy Council was bound to decide
without reference to the address and answer, and the bias
<i>there</i> was to advise against the grant. Brougham, after
much ineffectual discussion, said in a tone of sarcastic contempt
that &lsquo;their hesitation and their scruples were ridiculous,
for the House of Commons would step in and cut them
both short and settle the question.&rsquo; This is doubtless true,
and he can effect it when he will; but how monstrous, then,
was the vote. The House of Commons had never heard a tittle
of the evidence or the argument; the Council had heard it all,
and were bound to report upon it, when the House, while
the judgment of the Privy Council was still pending, voted
an address to the Crown for the purpose of obtaining an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
adjudication of the matter one particular way, without reference
to the proceedings before the tribunal. They all
seemed agreed that if it was expedient to grant a charter it
required much consideration to decide under what restrictions
and regulations it should be conceded, and Lord Grey
declared that if he was called upon, without reference to
any proceedings elsewhere, to decide upon the arguments
they had heard at the bar, he should decide against giving
the charter, but if he were called upon to advise the Crown
what under all the circumstances it was expedient to do, his
advice might be very different. Graham said he could not
divest his mind of the knowledge he possessed of what
had passed in the House of Commons, and he thought the
Government ought to advise the Crown on its own responsibility
what course it was expedient to adopt. After wasting
an hour and a half in a very fruitless and not very interesting
discussion (everybody looking bored to death except
Brougham, who was talking all the time) the Council broke
up without doing anything, and agreed to meet again on
Friday next. Old Eldon was very busy and eager about it,
and had all the papers sent to him; he could not attend,
being wholly disabled by the gout. Of course the charter
(at least <i>a</i> charter) will be given, because the House of
Commons in the plenitude of their ignorance, but of their
power, have so decided.</p>

<h3>June 14th, 1835</h3>

<p>Taken up with Epsom since I last wrote,
and indisposed to journalising, besides having nothing to say.
I did not attend the second meeting at the Privy Council on
the London University question. Lord Eldon came to it,
and there was some discussion, but without any violence;
it ended by a report to the King, requesting he would dispense
with the advice of the Council; so the matter remains
with the Government. It is clear that they would have
advised against granting the charter but for the answer
which the King made to the address of the House of
Commons, which was in fact a <i>promise</i> to grant it. This
answer was the work of Peel and Goulburn, and I can&rsquo;t
imagine what induced them to put such an one into his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY.</span>
Majesty&rsquo;s mouth, when they might have so properly made
him say that he had referred the matter to the Privy Council,
and was waiting for their report.</p>

<p>The calm and repose which have succeeded to the storms
of the early part of the session are really wonderful; all
parties seem disposed to lay aside their arms for the present,
one reason of which is that parties are so evenly balanced
that neither wishes to try its strength. Then the line
which Peel is taking precludes any immediate renewal of
hostilities. The measures of Government are confined to
one or two questions, of which the Corporation Reform has
alone been brought forward. Peel made a very able and
dexterous speech upon John Russell&rsquo;s introduction of that
measure, in which he exhibited anew his great superiority,
and at once declared his intention of admitting the whole
principle of it, reserving to himself to deal as he thought fit
with the details. It has been asserted on both sides that
the Whigs and the High Tories are equally disgusted at
his speech, the former for cutting the ground from under his
feet, the latter for his departure from good old High Tory
principles. There may be some truth in this, but the Tories
profess generally to be satisfied and convinced, and to be
quite ready to follow him in the liberal course on which he
has entered; so much so that it is now said there is no longer
such a thing as a Tory. Peel clearly does not intend that
there shall be (as far as he is concerned as their leader) a
<i>Tory</i> party, though of course there must be a <i>Conservative</i>
party, the great force of which is the old Tory interest, and
his object evidently is to establish himself in the good
opinion of the country and render himself indispensable&mdash;to
raise a party out of all other parties, and to convert the new
elements of democratic power into an instrument of his own
elevation, partly by yielding to and partly by guiding and
restraining its desires and opinions. Neither is there any
mystery in his conduct; his object and his intentions are
evident to all, and it is perhaps advantageous that he has
nothing to conceal. At the same time he plays this game
with great prudence and ability. It is not his interest to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
strike great blows, but constantly to augment the reputation
and extend the influence he has acquired, and this he does
visibly and sensibly. There seems to be an universal impression
that nothing can keep him out of office long. This
Government may probably scramble through the session;
there is no particular question on which they are likely to
be overturned, but there is a conviction that any Government
must be provisional in which Peel is not included, and
that before long the country will insist upon his return to
power.</p>

<h3>June 19th, 1835</h3>

<p>At Stoke for the Ascot races. Alvanley was
there&mdash;nobody else remarkable; fine weather and great
luxury. Riding to the course on Wednesday, I overtook
Adolphus Fitzclarence in the Park, who rode with me, and
gave me an account of his father&rsquo;s habits and present state
of mind. The former are as follows:&mdash;He sleeps in the same
room with the Queen, but in a separate bed; at a quarter
before eight every morning his <i>valet de chambre</i> knocks at
the door, and at ten minutes before eight exactly he gets out
of bed, puts on a flannel dressing-gown and trousers, and
walks into his dressing-room. Let who will be there, he
never takes the slightest notice of them till he emerges from
this sanctuary, when, like the <i>malade imaginaire</i>, he accosts
whoever may be present with a cheerful aspect. He is long at
his ablutions, and takes up an hour and a half in dressing.
At half-past nine he breakfasts with the Queen, the ladies,
and any of his family; he eats a couple of fingers and
drinks a dish of coffee. After breakfast he reads the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Morning Post,&rsquo; commenting aloud on what he reads
in very plain terms, and sometimes they hear &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a
damned lie,&rsquo; or some such remark, without knowing to what
it applies. After breakfast he devotes himself with Sir
Herbert Taylor to business till two, when he lunches (two
cutlets and two glasses of sherry); then he goes out for a
drive till dinner time; at dinner he drinks a bottle of sherry&mdash;no
other wine&mdash;and eats moderately; he goes to bed soon
after eleven. He is in dreadfully low spirits, and cannot
rally at all; the only interval of pleasure which he has lately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">KING WILLIAM&rsquo;S PERSONAL HABITS.</span>
had was during the Devonshire election, when he was delighted
at John Russell&rsquo;s defeat. He abhors all his Ministers,
even those whom he used rather to like formerly, but hates
Lord John the most of all. When Adolphus told him that a
dinner ought to be given for the Ascot races he said, &lsquo;You
know I cannot give a dinner; I cannot give any dinners
without inviting the Ministers, and I would rather see the
Devil than any one of them in my house.&rsquo; I asked him
how he was with them in his inevitable official relations.
He said that he had as little to do with them as he could,
and bowed them out when he gave any of them audiences as
fast as possible. He is peculiarly disgusted with Errol, for
whom he has done so much, and who has behaved so ungratefully
to him; but it is a good trait of him that he said
&lsquo;he hoped the world would not accuse Errol of ingratitude.&rsquo;
He did not invite Errol to the Castle even for the Ascot
races, and has seen little or nothing of him since the change.
Adolphus said that he believed he was saving money. He
has 120,000&#8467;. a year, of which 40,000&#8467;. goes in pensions; the
rest is at his own disposal. He gives up his Hanoverian
revenue&mdash;about 16,000&#8467;. a year&mdash;to the Duke of Cambridge.</p>

<h3>June 21st, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday I dined with Lord Ripon; Lord
Grey and Stanley and Graham dined there. I sat next to
the latter, who holds nothing but Tory language. He talked
of Stanley&rsquo;s letter to Sir Thomas Hesketh, and of the great
offence it has given the Tories. Graham thought it indiscreet
and uncalled for, though in the principles (anti-clubbism
and anti-associations) he agreed. Graham is very full of the
expedition to
Spain,<a name="FNA_28_07" id="FNA_28_07"></a><a href="#FN_28_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and expresses much alarm at the idea
of an army being formed which is to act independently of
the control and authority of the Government, to be composed
of Irish Catholics, supplied by O&rsquo;Connell (who, he says, has
been to Alava and offered him any number of men) and
commanded by Evans, who is a Republican. He believes
that Peel entertains the same sentiments of aversion and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
alarm that he does; but he said that when he attempted
to draw from him his opinion the other night he could not
succeed; that Stanley has no alarm on the subject; expects
that on Wednesday next Peel will make a severe attack upon
the Government on this matter; [but this fell to the ground].</p>

<p>In the morning yesterday I was in court for the unfortunate
case of Swift and Kelly, about which I cannot help
taking an interest from having been originally concerned in
it, and because I think there has been great villany somewhere.
Some of the circumstances connected with this
appeal are curious, as showing the accidents on which the
issue of matters of vital importance to the parties often depend,
and how the mistakes or selfishness of individuals
concerned may influence the result, and in a way they little
expected or calculated upon.</p>

Committee on West India places, and menaced with a report
that will be fatal to my
case.<a name="FNA_28_08" id="FNA_28_08"></a><a href="#FN_28_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Graham has been very obliging
about it, and attended the Committee on Thursday to
see what they were about and give me notice. I went to Lord
Melbourne yesterday and stated my case to him, invoking
his protection, and he appeared extremely well disposed to
do what he could for me. I told him I did not wish him to
pledge himself till he had seen the case and considered it,
such as I had laid it before the Committee; and then, if he
is satisfied that I stand upon tenable grounds, I will ask him
to exert his influence and authority in my behalf. However,
I much doubt whether, strive and struggle as I may, I shall
ever escape from the determination of this morose and rigid
millionaire [Francis Baring, who was not, however, a millionaire
or anything like it, either <i>in præsenti</i> or <i>in futuro</i>]
to strip me of my property; and I have made up my mind
to its loss, though resolved to fight while I have a leg to
fight upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM AND THE PRIVY COUNCIL.</span>
Yesterday we were again occupied all day with Swift and
Kelly, which to-day will be brought to a close. The conduct
of Brougham on this trial exceeds all imagination and belief.
From the beginning he has taken a one-sided view of the
case, and apparently set out with a bias which has continually
increased, till he has become altogether identified, and in a
manner passionately identified, with the appellant&rsquo;s side; and
he exhibits this bias by one continual course of advocacy,
battling every argument and every point with the respondent&rsquo;s
counsel with a virulence and an intemperance that
are so disgusting that my blood boils while I listen to him.
But his conduct in all other respects displays the most
extraordinary contrast with that of the other judges who sit
there; they, at least, listen attentively and consecutively to
the whole case, and when they do interrupt it is for the purpose
of obtaining explanations and elucidations, and without
the exhibition of any bias. But he is writing letters, reading
newspapers, cutting jokes, attending only by fits and starts;
then, when something smites his ear, out he breaks, and with
a mixture of sarcasm and ribaldry and insolence he argues
and battles the point, whatever it may be.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon.</i>&mdash;I am just come from the court. Lushington
finished his speech at two, and when Pemberton was about
to reply Brougham announced that he must go away to the
London University, where he was to distribute prizes. The
consequence was that the reply was deferred till next Wednesday,
and the parties will be put to the expense of 60&#8467;.
more. His conduct to-day was exactly of a piece with that
which he has exhibited throughout the trial. With all the
ingenuity and astuteness of which he is master he has attacked
every part of the respondent&rsquo;s case; and, to do him
justice, he has often displayed great acuteness and expressed
himself with admirable force and precision; but it was the
conduct of an advocate and not of a judge, and a much
better advocate has he been for Swift than either of those he
retained. (Pemberton, however, conducted the case with
consummate skill and judgment.) He finished by declaring
that as far as he was concerned he should not desiderate a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
reply, except on one or two points on which he wished to hear
it. After the court broke up Baron Parke came into my
room and asked my opinion, at the same time telling me his
own, which was as decidedly against the girl as Brougham&rsquo;s.
I argued the case with him, especially the points which
Lushington failed to enforce as strongly as I think he might
have done, but his mind was made up. Shadwell, on the
contrary, leans the other way, and agreed with me in my
view of it. It is, however, very clear that nothing can
prevent the reversal of Sir John Nicholl&rsquo;s judgment; for
Erskine will very likely go with Brougham and Parke, and
if he does not Lord Lansdowne undoubtedly will; but if I
were to attend this court a hundred years I should never
forget the conduct of Brougham on this trial. My disgust
would not have been a jot less had he espoused the same
side that I do; and if I were myself engaged in a suit, and
he were to take up my own cause in such a barefaced and
outrageous manner, with such an utter contempt of dignity
and decency, I should feel the utmost shame at such partiality,
though exerted in my behalf.</p>

<h3>June 30th, 1835</h3>

<p>I went to Melbourne on Sunday and carried
him my
case.<a name="FNA_28_09" id="FNA_28_09"></a><a href="#FN_28_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
He told me he had already desired Spring
Rice to speak to Baring on the subject, and I believe he will
do what he can; but these great people, however well disposed,
can seldom be urged into sufficient resolution and
activity to take an energetic way of settling the matter, and
they have always so much consideration for each other that
Melbourne will probably, with all his good-nature, feel a sort
of delicacy to his subordinate colleague in rescuing me from
his clutches. Yesterday I went to the Duke of Wellington
and gave him my case to read, requesting him to exert his
influence with his Tories, and get them to attend the Committee
and defend me there. He read it, approved, and
promised to speak to both Peel and Herries. I had previously
desired George Dawson to speak to Peel. I might
certainly, after the very essential services I rendered Peel
and his Government, go with some confidence to Peel or any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE POPE AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.</span>
of them and ask for their aid in my difficulty; but it is not
wise to remind men of an obligation; if they do not feel it
without being reminded they will not be made to do so by
any hint, and an accusation of ingratitude will be implied,
which will only excite their resentment; if they are sensible
of the obligation they will return it without any reminder.</p>

[Relating to the Secretaryship of Jamaica.]</p></div>

<p>After I had said what I had to say to Melbourne he
asked me what was thought of the Tithe Bill. I told him it
was thought a very outrageous measure by the Tories, but that
I thought it useless and that it did not go far enough. &lsquo;I
know you do,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but such as it is it will very likely
overturn the Government.&rsquo; He then talked over the Irish
question, and owned that nothing could settle it, that <i>they</i>
might perhaps bolster up the Irish Church a little longer
than the other party could, that they, however, could not do
<i>more</i> than this now, and it was only doubtful if they could
do <i>this</i>. He talked the language of reason, and with a just
sense of the insuperable difficulties which present themselves
on all sides with respect to this question, but at the same
time of their eventual (though as to time uncertain) solution.
I told him that I had long been of opinion that the only
practicable and sound course was to open a negotiation with
Rome, and to endeavour to deal with the Catholics in Ireland
and the ministers of the Catholic religion upon the same
plan which had been <i>mutatis mutandis</i> adopted universally
in Germany and almost all over the Continent, and that
there was nothing the Church of Rome desired so much as
to cultivate a good understanding with us. He then told
me a thing that surprised me, and which seemed to be at
variance with this supposition&mdash;that an application had been
made to the Pope very lately (through Seymour) expressive
of the particular wish of the British Government, that he
would not appoint M&lsquo;Hale to the vacant Catholic bishoprick,
<i>anybody but him</i>, notwithstanding which the Pope had appointed
M&lsquo;Hale; but on this occasion the Pope made a shrewd
observation. His Holiness said that &lsquo;he had remarked for
a long time past that no piece of preferment of any value
ever fell vacant in Ireland that he did not get an application
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
from the British Government asking for the appointment.&rsquo;
Lord Melbourne supposed he was determined to show that
he had the power of refusing and of opposing the wishes of
Government, and in reply to my question he admitted that
the Pope had generally conferred the appointment according
to the wishes of Government. Can anything be more absurd
or anomalous than such relations as these? The law prohibits
any intercourse with Rome, and the Government whose
business it is to enforce the law has established a regular
but underhand intercourse, through the medium of a diplomatic
agent, whose character cannot be avowed, and the
Ministers of this Protestant kingdom are continually soliciting
the Pope to confer appointments, the validity, even the
existence, of which they do not recognise, while the Pope,
who is the object of our orthodox abhorrence and dread,
good-humouredly complies with all or nearly all their requests.
These are the national and legislative follies of this wise and
prosperous people, and such is the false position into which
we are drawn by a long course of detestable policy&mdash;policy
arising at first out of circumstances, and eventually adhered
to from those powerful prejudices which struck their roots
so deep into the soil that the force of reason and philosophy
has not yet been sufficient to tear them up. Peel, in one of
his speeches on Catholic emancipation, bade the House of
Commons not to deceive itself, and to be aware that if that
Bill was carried, we must have Episcopal (or Protestant)
England, Presbyterian Scotland, and Catholic Ireland. He
prophesied well and truly no doubt, and to that consummation
affairs will eventually come, as they ought to come,
though not without many a struggle, through many a year.
The prophecy of Peel is advancing to its accomplishment,
but he has either forgotten it or finds it convenient to forget
it.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Duke of Wellington talked about the Spanish
war, the nature of which he described very well, and expressed
his opinion that on the whole the Christinos have the
best chance; he said Zumalacarreguy was an able man, and
that his death must have a very important influence on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON ON SIR W. NAPIER.</span>
result. We talked of Napier&rsquo;s controversy with
Perceval.<a name="FNA_28_10" id="FNA_28_10"></a><a href="#FN_28_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
He said Napier had not fairly treated Perceval&rsquo;s character
in the controversy, said he had never read a syllable of the
book, in order to keep clear of discussions, but that when
the work was completed, and all controversies were silenced,
he might probably look it over, and if he discovered any
errors tell the author of them. He said that no doubt the
army had been greatly in want of money, but that this was
not the fault of the Government. It was a great mistake to
suppose that any advantage had been derived (as to obtaining
funds) from the bank restriction; certainly the raising
of loans was facilitated by it, but the war would have been
much less expensive without it, and he had always been of
opinion that the immediate cause of the bank restriction was
the Loyalty Loan. This loan had drained the bankers and
individuals of ready money, and the consequence was a stagnation
in commerce, and therefore in circulation, which
rendered the bank restriction necessary. He then talked
of the Walcheren expedition, and said that though it was
wretchedly conducted and altogether mismanaged, it was
not ill-planned, and if they had gone straight to Antwerp
it might have rendered very great service to the general
cause, and have put Bonaparte in great difficulties. I had
always fancied that he had disapproved of that expedition.</p>

<h3>July 1st, 1835</h3>

<p>This morning Pemberton was heard in reply
in Swift&rsquo;s case, and after a short discussion the court came
to a resolution to upset Sir John Nicholl&rsquo;s decision.
Brougham behaved very decently to-day, and stated fairly
enough his opinion, but he was quite clear, and so was Baron
Parke, as to the judgment. The Vice-Chancellor with hesitation
acquiesced, and Erskine said nothing; the Lord President
went with them, so that the court was unanimous.</p>

<p>From thence I went to St. James&rsquo;s to swear in Sir Charles
Grey<a name="FNA_28_11" id="FNA_28_11"></a><a href="#FN_28_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and Charles Fitzroy Privy Councillors, when we had
a most curious burst of eloquence from his Majesty. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
is the first time I have seen him and his present Ministers
together, and certainly they do not strike me as exhibiting
any mutual affection. After Sir Charles Grey was sworn
the King said to him, &lsquo;Stand up,&rsquo; and up he stood. He
then addressed him with great fluency and energy nearly in
these words:&mdash;&lsquo;Sir Charles Grey, you are about to proceed
upon one of the most important missions which ever left
this country, and, from your judgment, ability, and experience,
I have no doubt that you will acquit yourself to my entire
satisfaction; I desire you, however, to bear in mind that the
colony to which you are about to proceed has not, like other
British colonies, been peopled from the mother country&mdash;that
it is not an original possession of the Crown, but that it was
obtained <i>by the sword</i>. You will take care to assert those undoubted
prerogatives which the Crown there possesses, and
which I am determined to enforce and maintain, and I charge
you by the oath which you have just taken strenuously to assert
those prerogatives, <i>of which persons who ought to have known
better have dared even in my presence to deny the existence</i>.&rsquo;
His speech was something longer than this, but the last words
almost precisely the same. The silence was profound, and I
was amused at the astonishment depicted on the faces of the
Ministers. I asked Lord Lansdowne and Lord Holland who
it was that he alluded to. Neither knew, but the former said
he thought it might be Ellice, and that the King referred to
something Ellice had said to him when he was Minister.
Somebody said they thought it was Spring Rice, but that
could not be when Rice was sitting at the table. I have
heard many specimens of his eloquence, but never anything
like this. After this he had to give Durham an audience
on his embassy, which must have been very agreeable to
him, as he hates him and the Duchess of Kent, whose
&lsquo;magnus Apollo&rsquo; Durham is.</p>

[Sir Charles Grey had just been appointed Governor of Jamaica. He
had previously filled for a short time the office of Chief Justice of Bengal,
and enjoyed at this time a considerable reputation in society. The Minister
to whom the King referred in his concluding observation was Lord Glenelg
as will be seen presently.]</p></div>

<h3>July 3rd, 1835</h3>

<p>The night before last Lord Stanley and Graham
quitted their neutral seats below the gangway, and established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD STANLEY AND GRAHAM CROSS THE HOUSE.</span>
themselves on the opposite bench below Peel. This was
considered as an intimation of a more decided hostility to
the present Government, and as an abandonment of the
neutrality (if such it can be called) which they have hitherto
professed. Last night O&rsquo;Connell made a very coarse attack
upon Stanley in consequence of this change, which lashed
him into a fury, and a series of retorts followed between
them, without any result. O&rsquo;Connell half shuffled out of his
expressions, but refused to apologise; the chairman (Bernal)
took no notice, and the matter ended by a speech from Stanley
and a few remarks upon it from Lord John Russell. The former
stated his reasons for this ostentatious locomotion, which
amounted to this: that he had been rudely treated in the
House by ironical cheers and other intelligible sounds, and
attacked by the Government newspapers, and he had, therefore,
departed from a society for which he owned he was not
fitted. It was not, I think, dignified or judicious, and George
Bentinck, the most faithful of his followers, was not satisfied
with the proceeding or the explanation. His party, such as
it was, was finally extinguished by this act, though it hardly
had any existence before; some five or six men, among whom
were Gally Knight, George Bentinck, Stratford Canning,
and Sir Matthew Ridley, went over to the Opposition benches;
the others dispersed where they chose.</p>

<p>The real history of the transaction is this: it originated
with Graham, and it is not the first time he has lugged
Stanley into what may be called a scrape. He was returning
from some division to his usual seat when he was assailed by
those cheers, and some voice cried out, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay
where you are?&rsquo; on which he bowed in acquiescence to the
quarter whence the recommendation proceeded, and instantly
retreated to the other side. The next day he told Stanley that
<i>he</i> must now stay where he was, and at the same time he
produced the &lsquo;Globe&rsquo; newspaper, which contained a very
coarse attack upon Stanley himself. This article, together
with Graham&rsquo;s representation, determined him to take up
his position on the Opposition bench, and accordingly there
he went, but without any intimation to his friends, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to their great surprise, found him there, and only got from
him the above explanation that evening in the House. Lord
John Russell&rsquo;s reply to Stanley&rsquo;s speech was very courteous,
and rather well done as  far as it went, for he only said
a few words. Lord Stanley is certainly fallen from his high
estate, and is in a very different position from that which
he aspired to occupy at the beginning of the session.
He is without a party, and without any authority in the
House except what he derives from his own talents  for
debate. He has now no alternative but to unite himself
with Peel&rsquo;s party, and to act under him, without any pretension
to competition, and without the possibility of being
considered as a separate element of political power. He has
been brought to this by a series of false steps from his first
refusal to join Peel, followed by his flippant and undecided
conduct throughout the great contest. The Whigs and the
Tories both hate him, and neither will be very ready to
forgive him. There is a mixture of contempt in the dislike
of the former, and an undisguised satisfaction among the
most violent at having got rid of him, which make any
future approximation to their side impossible, and the Tories,
though they will receive him in their ranks, will never forgive
him for his conduct, to which they attribute the failure
of the Conservative effort, for his presumption in endeavouring
to set up a middle party and render himself the arbiter of
the contest, and especially for his affectation of want of
confidence in Peel and his  attacks upon the Duke. In
the meantime this move of Stanley&rsquo;s has rather served to
strengthen the Government in the House of Commons;
between the disposition of many to go with Government,
the lukewarmness and indolence of the Conservatives, and
the steady attendance of a phalanx of Radicals, they have
got good, regular, steady-working majorities, and appear as
strong in the House of Commons as any Government need be.</p>

<h3>July 4th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday Brougham gave judgment in the
case of Swift and Kelly&mdash;a written judgment and at great
length. I thought it remarkably well done, embracing all
the points of the case, and laying down the law and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ALAVA AND THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND.</span>
reasons for reversing the decree of the court below in a very
forcible and perspicuous manner. He must have written
this judgment with great rapidity, for it was only on Tuesday
afternoon that it was settled to be given on Thursday,
all of which is a proof of his admirable talents. His conduct
on the last day of the hearing and this judgment in
some degree made up for his previous intemperance and
violence. He said that he had shown the judgment to Lord
Lyndhurst, who entirely agreed with him. A negotiation
had been previously opened to endeavour to get the other
side to concur in an application to the court to stay the
judgment and to consent to a pecuniary compromise, but it
was quite ineffectual.</p>

<p>A night or two ago there was a breeze at Lady Jersey&rsquo;s
between the Duke of Cumberland and Alava, and many
stories made of it, more than were true. The Duke, who
had frequently taunted him before, was again attacking
him about his expedition and Spanish affairs generally,
when Alava got into a fury and said to him, &lsquo;Monseigneur,
Don Carlos peut être roi d&rsquo;Espagne, mais il ne sera jamais
le roi du général Alava.&rsquo; This Lord Jersey told me, and
that the other things he is reported to have said to the Duke
are not true.</p>

<h3>July 7th, 1835</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t deny that many persons have shown a
very kind disposition to assist me in this business of my
Jamaica place, of different political persuasions, and with
most of whom I have but a very slight personal acquaintance,
among these none more than Mr. Gladstone and Lord
Lincoln, neither of whom did I know to speak to till I put
myself into communication with them on this business. On
the other hand Charles Wood, who is against me in his
opinion, has been the channel of communication with Baring
and shown generally a good will towards me. These demonstrations
are agreeable enough, and contribute to put
one in harmony with mankind, but it is after all a humiliating
position, and I feel unutterable disgust, and something
akin to shame, at being compelled to solicit the protection
of one set of men, and the friendly offices of another, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
order to be maintained in the possession of that which is in
itself obnoxious to public feeling and opinion. A placeman
is in these days an odious animal, and as a double placeman
I am doubly odious, and I have a secret kind of whispering
sensation that these very people who good-naturedly
enough assist me must be a little shocked at the cause they
advocate. All that can be said in my favour is not obvious,
nor can it be properly or conveniently brought forward, and
all that can be said against me lies on the surface, and is
universally evident. The funds from which I draw my
means do not somehow seem a pure source; formerly those
things were tolerated, now they are not, and my prospects
were formed and destiny determined at a remote period,
while I incur all the odium and encounter all the risks consequent
upon the altered state of public feeling on the subject.</p>

<h3>July 15th, 1835</h3>

<p>Sefton told me that a correspondence has
taken place between Lord Glenelg and Sir Herbert Taylor
about that speech of the King&rsquo;s at the Council on Wednesday
se&rsquo;nnight. Glenelg felt himself called upon to enquire
whether the blow was aimed at him, and it was evident from
the tenor of the reply that it was. I heard from Stephen a
day or two afterwards the real truth of this matter. It was
Lord Glenelg that the King intended to allude to in his
speech. Lord Melbourne spoke to his Majesty on the subject,
remonstrated, and said it was impossible to carry on
the government if he did such things. He said that he was
greatly irritated, and had acted under strong feelings in
consequence of what Glenelg had said to him. Melbourne
rejoined, &lsquo;Your Majesty must have mistaken Lord Glenelg.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said the King, and he then went into a
dispute they had had about the old constitution of Canada&mdash;I
forget what, but something the King asserted which
Glenelg contradicted. He repaired to the Colonial Office
and told Stephen, who informed him that the King was
right and he was wrong. (The King, in fact, had got it
up, and had the thing at his fingers&rsquo; ends.) This was
awkward; however, it ended in the King&rsquo;s making a sort of
apology and crying <i>peccavi</i> for the violence of his language,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS.</span>
and this will probably be somewhat of a lesson to him,
though it will not diminish the bitterness of his sentiments
towards his Ministers.</p>

<p>I expressed my astonishment that any man could consent
to stay in office after receiving such an insult as this was, to
which Stephen replied that they were all thoroughly aware
of their position relatively to the King and of his feelings
towards them; but they had undertaken the task and were
resolved under all circumstances to go through with it, and,
whatever he might say or do, they should not suffer themselves
to be influenced or shaken. This is the truth; they do
not look upon themselves as <i>his</i> Ministers, and perhaps they
cannot do otherwise as things now are. It is, however, a
very melancholy and mischievous state of affairs, and does
more to degrade the Monarchy than anything that has
ever occurred: to exhibit the King publicly to the world as
a cypher, and something less than a cypher, as an unsuccessful
competitor in a political squabble, is to take from the
Crown all the dignity with which it is invested by that
theoretical attribute of perfection that has been so conveniently
ascribed to it. Both King and Ministers have been
greatly to blame, the one for the egregious folly which made
him rush into this sea of trouble and mortification without
calculation or foresight; the other for the unrelenting severity
with which they resolved to gratify their revenge and
ambition, without considering that they could not punish
him without degrading the throne of which he is the
occupant, and that the principle involved in his impunity
was of more consequence in its great and permanent results
than any success of theirs. But it would have required
more virtue, self-denial, wisdom, and philosophy than falls to
the lot of any public man individually in these days to have
embraced all these considerations, and it would have been a
miracle if a great mob of men calling themselves a party
could have been made to act under the influence of such
moral restraints. The King&rsquo;s present behaviour only makes
matters worse. When he found himself compelled to take
these people back, and to surrender himself a prisoner into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
their hands, he should have swallowed the bitter pill and
digested it, and not kept rolling it in his mouth and making
wry faces. He should have made a very bad business as
tolerable as he could, by yielding himself with a good grace;
and had he treated them with that sort of courtesy which
one gentleman may and ought to show to all those with
whom he is unavoidably brought into contact, and which
implies nothing as to feeling and inclination, he would have
received from them that respect and attention which it would
have been equally their interest and their desire to show.
This would have rendered their relations mutually much
more tolerable, a decent veil would have been thrown over
all that was humiliating and painful, and the public service
must have gained by the tacit compromise; but extreme
folly, great violence in those about the King, and hopes of
emancipation secretly cherished, together with the intensity
of his hatred of his Ministers, have conspired to keep his
Majesty in his present unwise, irksome, and degrading
posture.</p>

<p>The night before last there was a great concert on the
staircase at Stafford House, the most magnificent assembly I
ever saw, and such as I think no crowned head in Europe
could display, so grand and picturesque. The appearance of
the hall was exactly like one of Paul Veronese&rsquo;s pictures,
and only wanted some tapestry to be hung over the balustrades.
Such prodigious space, so cool, so blazing with
light; everybody was <i>comfortable</i> even, and the concert combined
the greatest talents in Europe all together&mdash;Grisi,
Malibran, Tamburini, Lablache, Rubini, and Ivanhoff. The
splendour, the profusion, and the perfect ease of it all were
really admirable.</p>

<p>Dined yesterday with the Vice-Chancellor; sixteen
people whom I never saw before, almost all lawyers and
lawyeresses. He told me that he believed Melbourne had
no intention as long as he was Minister of changing the
present arrangement with regard to the Great
Seal,<a name="FNA_28_12" id="FNA_28_12"></a><a href="#FN_28_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DECISION OF THE WEST INDIA COMMITTEE.</span>
was of opinion that a Chancellor was of no use, and that it
was more convenient to keep in his own hands the law
patronage of the Great Seal, that this obviated the disputes
between Ministers and Chancellors, which have generally
been very violent, as between Thurlow and Pitt, and still
more between Eldon and Liverpool, which were incessant,
and that nothing could exceed the hatred Eldon had for
Lord Liverpool, as he knew.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_28_12" id="FN_28_12"></a><a href="#FNA_28_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
[The Great Seal was still in Commission.]</p></div>

<p>Tavistock told me a day or two ago that his Majesty&rsquo;s
Ministers are intolerably disgusted at his behaviour to them
and his studied incivility to everybody connected with them.
The other day the Speaker was treated by him with shocking
rudeness at the drawing-room. He not only took no notice
of him, but studiously overlooked him while he was standing
opposite, and called up Manners Sutton and somebody
else to mark the difference by extreme graciousness to the
latter. Seymour, who was with him as Serjeant-at-Arms,
said he had never seen a Speaker so used in the five-and-twenty
years he had been there, and that it was most painful.
The Speaker asked him if he had ever seen a man in his
situation so received at Court. Since he has been Speaker
the King has never taken the slightest notice of him. It is
monstrous, equally undignified and foolish.</p>

<h3>July 18th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday I sat all day at my office wondering
why I heard nothing of the Committee, till at half-past
four o&rsquo;clock Graham and Lord Lincoln came in with smiling
countenances, that announced good news. They had had an
angry debate of three hours&rsquo; duration. Baring moved that
my holding the office of Secretary of Jamaica was against
the spirit of the Act of Parliament. Graham moved that
holding it with the leave of absence was in accordance with
the Act, and the division was nine to seven. A teller on
each side and Baring, who as chairman did not vote, made
the numbers ten to nine. They told me that Baring and
Vernon Smith were furious. The former endeavoured to
turn off his defeat by proposing that the question should be
reopened on framing the report; but even Grote opposed
that, and he was forced to own that he was wrong in proposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
it. I must say that Gladstone told me that Baring
behaved very well after the division. I will not conceal the
truth, much as I have reason to complain of the man. I
owe this victory to the zealous assistance of the Conservatives,
for not one Whig or Radical voted with me; some
of the former stayed away, whether designedly or not I don&rsquo;t
know, except Stanley, Secretary to the Treasury, who told
me he could not make up his mind to go and vote against
me. The majority consisted of Herries, Fremantle (Sir
Thomas), Gladstone, Nicholl, Graham, Lord Lincoln, Bethell,
Fector, Bramstone, and Pringle; the minority, Baring, Vernon
Smith, Pendarves, Ruthven, Scholefield, Evans, Grote,
Hume, R. Stewart. I never had any intimacy with any one of
those who supported me except with Graham, and we were
friends, and very intimate friends, twenty years ago. He
dropped me all of a sudden from caprice or calculation, and
we have been on very decent but scarcely cordial terms ever
since. On this occasion I whipped up the old friendship,
and with great effect, for he has served me very zealously
throughout the business. I scarcely knew any of the other
before, Lord Lincoln and Gladstone only on this occasion,
and Fector, Nicholl, Bramstone, Bethell, and Pringle I do
not know now by sight. It is really amusing to see the joy
with which the news of Baring&rsquo;s defeat has been hailed by
every member of his own family, and all others who have
heard of it. The goodwill of the world (a very inert but
rather satisfactory feeling) has been exhibited towards me,
and there is mixed up with it in all who are acquainted with
the surly reformer who is my adversary a lively pleasure at
his being baffled and mortified.</p>

<h3>July 23rd, 1835</h3>

<p>Dined with Bingham
Baring<a name="FNA_28_13" id="FNA_28_13"></a><a href="#FN_28_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
yesterday, and
met Whateley, Archbishop of Dublin, a very ordinary man in
appearance and conversation, with something of pretension
in his talk, and telling stories without point, which smelt of
the Common room; nevertheless he is a very able man, and
they told me that when he is with such men as Senior, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRISH CHURCH BILL.</span>
those with whom he is very intimate, he shines. I was
greatly disappointed with what I saw and heard of him.
The Church Bill has been in the House of Commons these
two nights. Peel introduced his motion for dividing the
Bill in a very able speech, well adapted to the purpose, if
anything was to be gained in such a House of Commons;
but the fact is, both parties look beyond the immediate question:
one wants to bolster up the present system, the other
to overthrow it, and though I go along with Peel on his
<i>point</i>, I go along with his opponents on their <i>principle</i>. He
stated, however, very forcibly the dilemma in which his opponents
are placed, and said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make the Establishment
Catholic at once, openly and avowedly, or abstain
from doing what has that inevitable tendency?&rsquo; Melbourne
said there was no escape from this, and I replied that I would
take him at his word, and that it must come to this, and he
might immortalise himself by settling the question. It
certainly would be a glorious field for a statesman to enter
upon to brush away all the obstacles which deeply rooted
prejudices and chimerical fears founded on false reasoning
throw in his way, and bend all his energies to a direct and
vigorous course of policy, at once firm and determined,
looking the real evil in the face, and applying the real
remedy to it. If I were Prime Minister I would rather fall
in the attempt than work on through a succession of expedients
none of which were satisfactory to myself, to hold
language at variance with my opinions, and to truckle to
difficulties which it is now time boldly to face. I am as
satisfied as of my existence that if the heart&rsquo;s core of Peel
could be laid open, it would be found that he thinks so himself.
His is not the conduct of conviction, and he has been
led into contradictions and inconsistencies which must ever
beset and entangle those who persist in the attempt to
maintain positions which have ceased to be tenable.</p>

<h3>Goodwood, July 29th, 1835</h3>

<p>To Petworth on Saturday and here
on Monday; a smaller party than usual, and no women on
account of the Duchess of Argyll&rsquo;s death; far better not to
have women at a racing party. Tavistock told me that a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
(he did not say who) had been to Lord John, evidently commissioned,
though not avowedly, to tell him on the part of
Peel and Lord Stanley that they would both support him if he
would bring forward a proposition to pay the Irish Catholic
clergy. John, however, &lsquo;timet Danaos et dona ferentes,&rsquo;
and hinted that his own popularity would be sacrificed if he
did. This is curious, however. John also told him that he
never saw Peel laugh so much as during Graham&rsquo;s speech
the other night, and he meant (but forgot it) to ask him why
he laughed so. To Peel it is nuts to see Stanley and Graham
drawing down unpopularity on themselves and every day
widening the breach between them and their old friends; but
I was somewhat struck with the apparent intimacy which
was evinced in what John Russell said about Peel, and asked
his brother if they were on very good personal terms. He
said, &lsquo;Oh, excellent&rsquo;&mdash;a sort of House of Commons intimacy.
Peel told John all he meant to do in the Committee on the
Church Bill&mdash;that he should propose so and so, and when
they came to the appropriation clauses he should make his
bow and leave them. Tavistock remarked (which had escaped
me) that Peel had in his last famous speech (certainly one of
extraordinary ability) omitted all mention of the principle of
appropriation, and confined himself to the proof that there
was no surplus; but what is most remarkable perhaps of all
is this: Peel said to John, &lsquo;If you <i>will</i> appropriate, I will show
you a much better plan than your own,&rsquo; and he accordingly
did show him a plan by which there would be a considerably
greater surplus, and John acknowledged that Peel&rsquo;s plan
would be better than his own. I wonder what the High
Tories and the King would think of all this. While he is
quarrelling with Johnny and his friends for Peel&rsquo;s sake, and
undergoing martyrdom in his social relations with them,
there they are hand and glove, and almost concerting together
the very measures which are the cause of all the
animosities and all the political violence which agitate and
divide the world. There is something extremely ludicrous
in all this.</p>

<p>I hear to-day that Peel is going into the country for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TORY PEERS AND THE CORPORATION BILL.</span>
good, and leaves the Lords to deal with the Bills. He probably
expects them to commit some follies, and fancies he
may as well be out of the way.</p>

<h3>August 4th, 1835</h3>

<p>Came to town on Sunday, having slept at Winchester
on Saturday night to see the town and the cathedral,
and hear the service in the latter, which was very moderate;
the cathedral, however, is worth seeing. When I got to town
I found the Tory Lords had been worked into a frenzy by
Wetherell and
Knight<a name="FNA_28_14" id="FNA_28_14"></a><a href="#FN_28_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
at the bar of the House of Lords
(the latter of whom is said to have made a very able speech),
and Newcastle and Winchelsea bellowed and blustered in
grand style. Lord Rosslyn had told me some time ago that
the Duke would have great difficulty in managing his people,
but that I think was <i>à propos</i> of the Church Bill. Yesterday
at two o&rsquo;clock there was a great assemblage of Peers at
Apsley House to determine what was to be done, and amazed
was I when I learnt at about five o&rsquo;clock that they had
resolved to move that evidence should be heard against the
principle of the Municipal Corporation Bill, which was
accordingly moved by Carnarvon last night. At dinner I met
Stuart, to whom I expressed my astonishment at the course
they had adopted, and he owned that it was &lsquo;rather hazardous,&rsquo;
and said that it was adopted at the suggestion of Lyndhurst,
who had insisted upon it at Apsley House, and that
the Duke had given way. He said that this had followed
as a necessary consequence of Brougham proposing that
counsel should be heard upon the details, as it appeared that
the evidence on which the Bill was founded was not to be
relied on. He owned that it was probable Peel would disapprove
of the proceedings of the Lords, and a breach between
him and them be the consequence. He told me that at a
dinner on Saturday, at which the Dukes of Wellington and
Cumberland, Peel, and Wetherell were present, the question
had been argued; that Sir Charles Wetherell had urged all
the leading arguments he had used in his speech, and Peel
had contested every part and particle of his argument, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the Duke of Cumberland did not utter a word. Stuart added
that he heard the Government meditated something very
strong, and I repeated what Hobhouse had told me in the
morning, when I met him in the Park&mdash;that Melbourne would
probably adjourn the House, that there would be a call of
the House of Commons, and some strong resolution proposed
there. Some Whigs, however, who were present last night,
suggested that it would be better to adjourn the House of
Commons, and let the Lords go on with their evidence while
they pleased to hear it, and then reassemble the Commons
in case the Bill was sent back to them. Hobhouse said,
&lsquo;Depend upon it, it is the <i>commencement de la fin</i>&rsquo;. It
does certainly appear to me that these Tory Lords will never
rest till they have accomplished the destruction of the House
of Lords. They are resolved to bring about a collision with
the House of Commons, and the majority in each House
grows every day more rabid and more desperate. I am at
a loss to comprehend the views by which Lyndhurst, the
ablest of the party, is actuated, or how he can (if it be so,
which from Stuart&rsquo;s account is probable) fancy that any
object is attainable which involves in it a breach or separation
between Peel and the great body of the Tories. I would
give much to see the recesses of his mind, and know what
he really thinks of all these proceedings, and to what consequences
he believes that they will lead.</p>

<h3>August 6th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday to Brighton, to see my horse
Dacre run for the Brighton stake, which he won, and back
at night. The day before I met the
Vice-Chancellor<a name="FNA_28_15" id="FNA_28_15"></a><a href="#FN_28_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
at
Charing Cross, going down, to the House of Lords. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said he, shrugging his shoulders, &lsquo;here I am going to the
House of Lords, after hearing evidence all the morning, to
hear it again for the rest of the evening.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is to happen?&rsquo;
I asked him. &lsquo;O Lord, it is the greatest bore; they have
heard Coventry and Oxford; they got something of a case
out of the first, but the other was beyond anything tiresome;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING AND LORD TORRINGTON.</span>
they are sick to death of it, and Brougham and Lyndhurst
have agreed that <i>it is all damned nonsense</i>, and they will hear
nothing more after Saturday next.&rsquo; So this is the end of all
this hubbub, and here are these two great comedians thundering
against each other in the House of Lords overnight
with all imaginable vehemence and solemnity, only to meet
together the next morning and agree that <i>it is all damned
nonsense</i>. There is something very melancholy and very
ludicrous in all this, and though that great bull calf the
public does not care about such things, and is content to
roar when he is bid, there are those on the alert who will
turn such trilling and folly to account, and convert what is
half ridiculous into something all serious. Winchelsea and
Newcastle after all did not vote the other night; they said
they wanted no evidence, that they would have no such Bill,
and would not meddle with the discussion at all except to
oppose it point-blank. Fools as they are, their folly is more
tolerable and probably less mischievous than the folly of the
wise ones.</p>

<h3>August 9th, 1835</h3>

<p>On Wednesday last at the levee the King
made a scene with Lord Torrington, one of his Lords of the
Bedchamber, and a very disgraceful scene. A card was put
into Torrington&rsquo;s hands of somebody who was presented,
which he read, &lsquo;So and so, <i>Deputy-Governor</i>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Deputy-Governor?&rsquo;
said the King, &lsquo;Deputy-Governor of what? I
cannot tell your Majesty,&rsquo; replied Torrington, &lsquo;as it is not
upon the card.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rsquo; said the King; &lsquo;you
had better go home and learn to read;&rsquo; and shortly after,
when some bishop presented an address against (I believe)
the Irish Tithe Bill, and the King was going as usual to
hand over the papers to the Lord in waiting, he stopped and
said to Lord Torrington, who advanced to take them, &lsquo;No,
Lord Torrington; these are not fit documents to be entrusted
to your keeping.&rsquo; His habitual state of excitement will probably
bring on sooner or later the malady of his family.
Torrington is a young man in a difficult position, or he
ought to have resigned instantly and as publicly as the insult
was offered. The King cannot bridle his temper, and lets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
slip no opportunity of showing his dislike, impotent as it
is, of the people who surround him. He admits none but
Tories into his private society, wherever he goes Tories accompany
him; at Windsor Tories only are his guests. This
provokes his Ministers, but it necessarily makes them more
indifferent to the cultivation of his favour, and accustoms
them to consider themselves as the Ministers of the House
of Commons and not of the Crown.</p>

<p>My brother writes me from Paris very interesting details
of the funeral of the victims of the assassination
plot,<a name="FNA_28_16" id="FNA_28_16"></a><a href="#FN_28_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
which
was an imposing and magnificent ceremony, admirably
arranged, and as it has produced a burst of enthusiasm for
the King, and has brought round the clergy to him, it will
serve to strengthen his throne. His undaunted courage
ingratiates him with the French.</p>

<h3>August 15th, 1835</h3>

<p>On Wednesday the Lords commenced proceedings
on the Corporation Bill. The Ministers were aware
that they meant to throw it out, for Lord John Russell and
Lord Lansdowne both told me at the levee that they had
heard such was the intention of the Tories. However, they
never had such a design, and the second reading passed without
a division; on Thursday they went into Committee, and the
freeman&rsquo;s clause was carried against Government by a
majority of 93&mdash;130 to 37&mdash;the debate being distinguished by
divers sallies of intemperance from Brougham, who thundered,
and menaced, and gesticulated in his finest style. When
somebody cried, &lsquo;Question,&rsquo; he burst out, &lsquo;Do you think to put
me down? I have stood against 300 of the House of Commons,
and do you think I will give way to <i>you</i>?&rsquo; This was uttered
with all imaginable rage and
scorn.<a name="FNA_28_17" id="FNA_28_17"></a><a href="#FN_28_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
This amendment was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEBATE ON THE CORPORATION BILL.</span>
always anticipated, and though the Government object to it,
Lord Lansdowne told me that as the rate-paying clause had
passed without opposition, he did not care for the other
alterations, but the minority appeared to everybody bordering
upon the ridiculous; a Minister who could only muster thirty-seven
present, and who was in a minority of three to one,
presented a novel spectacle. Nobody could account for the
carelessness of their muster, for many Peers were absent
who might easily have been there, and several who belong
to Government by office or connexion. It did not, however,
occur to anybody that they would feel themselves compelled
to resign upon it, except perhaps to a few Tories, who hinted
their notion that Melbourne could not go on with such a
majority against him, which, however true it may be in the
long run, signifies nothing as to any immediate change.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_28_17" id="FN_28_17"></a><a href="#FNA_28_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
Brougham had some reason to be angry. Lyndhurst did not reply to
him on Wednesday, when he might have done so, pleading the fatigue of
late hours and his own indisposition, and on Thursday he attacked him
when he was absent; he therefore gave him good ground of complaint.
Brougham&rsquo;s insolence and violence have done great injury to the House of
Lords by lowering the style and character of their debates and introducing
coarseness and acrimony such as never were known there before. Hardly a
night passes without some discreditable scene of squabbling and vituperation
bandied between him and the High Tory Lords, one or other of them;
their hatred of him and his scorn of them are everlastingly breaking out.
He and Lyndhurst, though constantly pitted against each other, are great
friends all the time, but with the others it is a rabid passion of hatred and
contempt, mutually felt and continually expressed.</p></div>

<p>Last night the qualification clause was carried against
Government by an equally large majority, or nearly so, and
this time Government does not seem disposed to take it so
patiently. It was well understood that a qualification would
be imposed, and many of the supporters of the Bill said they
did not object thereto, but they had no notion of such a
qualification as Lyndhurst proposed and carried last night, and
the Duke of Richmond (whom I met at Crockford&rsquo;s) told me
that it would be fatal to the Bill. He saw Lord John Russell
after the division, who told him so, and that the Commons
would never take the Bill with such an alteration as this.
Richmond himself goes entirely with Government in this
measure, and I was rather surprised to hear him say that &lsquo;it
had been urged that Lord Stanley was opposed to this part of
the Bill, but that if this were so a man must judge for himself
in so important a matter,&rsquo; which looks a little as if he meant to
back out of the dilly, and I should not be very much surprised
if he came into office again with these people, if they stay in.
I asked him what in his opinion would happen, and he replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that he thought the House of Lords was nearly done
for, that he expected the Commons would reject their amendments
and pass some very strong resolutions; he should not
be surprised if they refused to pass the Appropriation Bill.
I said they would hardly do that, because it would be a
measure against Government, and would compel these
Ministers to resign. This he admitted, but he went on to
say that he expected it would throw the House of Commons
into a ferment, that they would adopt some violent course,
and then there would be a &lsquo;row royal.&rsquo; What astonishes
me most in all this is that Lyndhurst, a man of great abilities,
and certainly, if wishing for anything, wishing for the success
of the party he belongs to, should urge these desperate courses.
He it was who proposed the fatal postponement of Schedule A,
which led to such utter ruin and confusion, and now it is
he who manages this Bill, and who ventures to mutilate the
Ministerial measure in such a manner as will in all probability
bring down all the wrath of the Commons on him
and his Conservative majority. I am not at all sure but that
the Government is content to exhibit its paltry numbers in
the House of Lords, in order that the world may see how
essentially it is a Tory body, that it hardly fulfils the conditions
of a great independent legislative assembly, but presents the
appearance of a dominant party-faction which is too numerous
to be affected by any constitutional process and too obstinate
to be turned from its fixed purpose of opposing all the measures
which have a tendency to diminish the influence of the Conservative
party in the country. It is impossible to look at
the disposition exhibited by this great majority and not
admit that there is very small chance of its acting harmoniously
with the present House of Commons, and that
some change must take place in order to enable Government
and legislation to go on at all. It is anything but clear that
the nation desires the destruction of the House of Lords, nor
is it clear that the nation cares for its preservation. It is,
I think, exceedingly probable that a majority of those who
return members to Parliament, and in whom collectively the
supreme power really resides, though they might be content
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ENERGY OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
to retain the House of Lords, if it could be made to act in
harmony with, and therefore necessarily in subordination to,
the House of Commons, would not hesitate for an instant to
decree its downfall if it became clear that there was no other
way of crushing the Tory faction which now rules triumphant
in that House. At all events the Lords are playing
a desperate game; if it succeeds, they who direct the energies
of the party are great and wise men; but what if it fail?
They seem to have no answer to this but that if they</p>

<h3>August 19th, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday the Lords finished the Committee
on the Corporation Bill. Their last amendment
(which I do not very well understand at present), by which
certain aldermen elected for life are to be taken in the
first instance from the present aldermen, has disgusted the
authors of the Bill more than all the rest. In the morning
I met Duncannon and Howick, both open-mouthed against
the amendments, and this in particular, and declaring that
though the others might have been stomached, this could
not go down, as it was in direct opposition to the principle
of the Bill. Howick talked of &lsquo;the Lords being swept away
like chaff&rsquo; and of &lsquo;the serious times that were approaching.&rsquo;
Duncannon said there would be a conference, and if the
Lords insisted on these amendments the Bill would be lost.
I asked if a compromise was not feasible, the Lords abandoning
this and the Commons taking the other amendments,
which he said would not be undesirable, but difficult to effect.
The continual discussions about this Bill have made me perforce
understand something of it towards the end of them.
I am too ignorant of the details and of the tendency of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MUNICIPAL CORPORATION BILL.</span>
Bill to have an opinion of the comparative merits of its
present and its original shape, but I am sure the Lords are
bound in prudence not to mutilate it more than is absolutely
necessary to make it a safe measure, and to have a good, and
moreover a popular, case to go to the country with, if eventually
such an appeal is to be made. On the other hand
the House of Commons, powerful as it is, must not assert its
power too peremptorily, and before the Ministers determine
to resign, for the purpose of making their resignation instrumental
to the consolidation of their power and the destruction
of the House of Lords; they also must have a good case,
and be able to show that the amendments made by the Lords
are incompatible with the object proposed, that they were
made in a factious spirit and for the express purpose of
thwarting the principle contended for, and that their conduct
in this matter forms part of a general system, which can
only be counteracted by some fundamental change in the
constitution of the Upper House itself. These are violent
conclusions to come to, and when one reflects calmly upon
the possible and probable consequences of a collision, and
the manner in which the interests of the antagonistic parties
collectively and individually are blended together, it is difficult
to believe that both will not pause on the brink of the
precipice and be influenced by a simultaneous desire to
come to a decent and practicable compromise. This would
probably be easy if both parties were actuated by a sincere
desire to enact a law to reform corporations in the safest,
best, and most satisfactory manner; but the reformation of
the corporations is not the first object in the minds of either.
One wants to save as much as possible of the Tory influence,
which is menaced by the Bill, and the other wants to court
the democratic spirit, which vivifies its party, and erect a
new and auxiliary influence on the ruins of the ancient
establishments. Any mere looker-on must perceive through
all their wranglings that these are the <i>arrière-pensées</i> of the
two antagonistic parties.</p>

<p>Brougham made a very clever speech (I am told) on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Monday night, and the contest between him and Lyndhurst
through the whole Committee has been remarkable for talent
and for a striking display of the different qualities of the
two men. The Duke of Richmond had a squabble with
Lyndhurst last night, &lsquo;impar congressus,&rsquo; and he has wriggled
himself almost back among the Whigs; nothing but the
appropriation clause in the Church Bill prevents his being
First Lord of the Admiralty, and he may be considered as
having dropped off the dilly with so many others. The Whigs
are dying to have him back among them. I must confess
I do not see why, but it is impossible to deny that he contrives
to make himself desired by those with whom he has
acted, and as they must know best what they are about and
what he is capable of, it is reasonable to suppose that he has
some talents or some qualities which are developed in the
graver affairs of life, but which do not appear in its ordinary
relations and habitudes. I thought what he said to me the
other night looked like a severance of his Stanley connexion,
and his strenuous support of this Bill and his pettish attacks
upon Lyndhurst show that he at least is not likely to ally
himself with the Conservatives.</p>

<h3>August 21st, 1835</h3>

<p>Yesterday I fell in with Lyndhurst, just
getting out of his carriage at his door in George Street. He
asked me to come in and look at his house, which I did. I
asked him what would happen about the Bill. He said, &lsquo;Oh,
they will take it. What can they do? If they choose to throw
it out, let them do so, I don&rsquo;t care whether they do or not.
But they will take it, because they know it does their business,
though not so completely as they desire.&rsquo; He said he would
alter the qualification, though he did not think it objectionable.
I told him I hoped there might be some compromise,
and that he and his friends would give way on some of their
amendments, and that the Commons would take the rest.
Even the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; which <i>goes the whole hog</i> with the Opposition,
won&rsquo;t swallow this (the aldermen), and suggests
that it should be withdrawn. Nothing ever was like the
outrageous indecency of the attacks upon the House of
Lords in the Ministerial papers, and it is not clear that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WHAT IS HAPPINESS?</span>
won&rsquo;t overdo the thing; this kind of fury generally defeats
its own object.</p>

<h3>August 25th, 1835</h3>

<p>At Hillingdon from Saturday till Monday
last; began the Life of Mackintosh, and was delighted with
Sydney Smith&rsquo;s letter which is prefixed to it; read and
walked all day on Sunday&mdash;the two things I do least, viz.
exercise my mind and body; therefore both grow gross
and heavy. Shakespeare says fat paunches make lean pates,
but this is taken from a Greek proverb. I admire this
family of Cox&rsquo;s at Hillingdon, and after casting my eyes in
every direction, and thinking much and often of the theory
of happiness, I am convinced that it is principally to be
found in contented mediocrity, accompanied with an equable
temperament and warm though not excitable feelings.
When I read such books as Mackintosh&rsquo;s Life, and see what
other men have done, how they have read and thought, a
sort of despair comes over me, a deep and bitter sensation
of regret &lsquo;for time misspent and talents misapplied,&rsquo; not the
less bitter from being coupled with a hopelessness of remedial
industry and of doing better things. Nor do I know that
such men as these were happy; that they possessed sources
of enjoyment inaccessible to less gifted minds is not to be
doubted, but whether knowledge and conscious ability and
superiority generally bring with them content of mind and
the sunshine of self-satisfaction to the possessors is anything
but certain. I wonder the inductive process has not been
more systematically applied to the solution of this great
philosophical problem, <i>what is happiness</i>, and <i>in what it consists</i>,
for the practical purpose of directing the human mind
into the right road for reaching this goal of all human wishes.
Why are not innumerable instances collected, examined, analysed,
and the results expanded, explained, and reasoned upon
for the benefit and instruction of mankind? Who can tell but
what these results may lead at last to some simple conclusions
such as it requires no vast range of intellect to
discover, no subtle philosophy to teach&mdash;conclusions mortifying
to the pride and vanity of man, but calculated to mitigate
the evils of life by softening mutual asperities, and by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
establishment of the doctrine of <i>humility</i>, from which all
charity, forbearance, toleration, and benevolence must flow
as from their source? These simple conclusions may amount
to no more than a simple maxim that happiness is to be
found &lsquo;in the pursuit of truth and the practice of virtue.&rsquo;</p>

Healthy body, healthy appetite, healthy feelings, though accompanied
by mediocrity of talent, unadorned with wit and
imagination, and unpolished by learning and science, will
outstrip in the race for happiness the splendid irregularities

the same time this general view of the probabilities of
happiness must be qualified by the admission that mere
vegetation scarcely deserves the name of happiness, and
that the highest enjoyment which humanity is capable of
may be said to consist in the pleasures of reason and imagination&mdash;of
a mind expatiating among the wonders of
nature, and ranging through all the &lsquo;changes of many-coloured
life,&rsquo; without being shaken from its equilibrium by
the disturbing causes of jealousy, envy, and the evil passions

despicable, unprofitable habits and pursuits?</p>

<h3>August 27th, 1835</h3>

<p>Melbourne has thrown up the Tithe Bill
in the Lords, because the Opposition expunged the appropriation
clauses. In the Corporation Bill Lyndhurst made
still further alterations, such as the Commons will not take
(the town clerks and the exclusion of Dissenters from the
disposal of ecclesiastical patronage), and as it is the general
opinion that they will make no compromise and surrender
none of their amendments, that Bill will probably be lost
too. What then? asks everybody, and nobody can tell
what then, but there is a sort of vague apprehension that
<i>something</i> must come of it, and that this collision (for collision
it is) between the Lords and the Commons will not be
terminated without some violent measures or important
changes; if such do take place, they will have been most
wantonly and wickedly brought about, but it is a lamentable
thing to see the two great parties in the country, equally
possessed of wealth and influence, and having the same
interest in general tranquillity, tearing each other to pieces
while the Radicals stand laughing and chuckling by, only
waiting for the proper moment to avail themselves of these
senseless divisions. There is something inconceivable, a sort
of political absurdity, in the notion of a country like this
being on the eve of a convulsion, when it is tranquil, prosperous,
and without any grievance; universal liberty prevails,
every man&rsquo;s property and person are safe, the laws are well
administered and duly obeyed; so far from there being any
unredressed grievances, the imagination of man cannot devise
the fiction or semblance of a grievance without there being
a rush to correct it.  The only real evil is that the rage for
correction is too violent, and sweeps all before it. What is
it, then, which menaces the existence of the constitution we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
live under? It is the fury of parties, it is the broad line of
separation which the Reform Bill has drawn, the antagonist
positions into which the two Houses of Parliament have been
thrown, and the Whigs having identified themselves with
the democratic principle in one House, in order to preserve
their places, and the Conservative principle having taken
refuge in the other House, where it is really endangered by
the obstinate and frantic violence of its supporters. What
was the loud and eternal cry of the Lords, and of all the
Conservatives, when the Reform Bill was in agitation? That
it was a revolution, that it would place all political power
in the hands of the people, that it would establish an irresistible
democratic force; and the great body of them justified
their refusal to go into Committee on the ground that the
Bill was so vicious in principle, so irremediably mischievous,
that no alterations could diminish its evil tendency. It is
now as clear as daylight that if they had gone into Committee
and amended the Bill, they might have obviated
all or nearly all the evils they apprehended, for even after
the passing of the &lsquo;whole Bill,&rsquo; with all its clauses perfect
and untouched, parties are so nearly balanced that the
smallest difference would turn the scale the other way. They
would, however, listen to nothing, and now they feel the
consequences of their <i>ruat c&oelig;lum</i> policy; but what I
complain of is, that after the verification of their predictions,
and the realisation of their fears, in the establishment of
a democratic power of formidable strength, they do not act
consistently with their own declared opinions; for if it be
true, as they assert, that their legitimate authority and
influence have been transferred to other hands, and that the
just equilibrium of the Constitution has been shaken, it is
mad and preposterous in them to act just as if no such disturbing
causes had occurred, as if they were still in the
plenitude of their constitutional power, and to provoke a
collision which, if their own assertions be true, they are no
longer in a condition to sustain. The answer to such arguments
as this invariably is, Are the Lords, then, to be content
to yield everything, and must they pass every Bill which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SECLUSION OF SIR R. PEEL.</span>
House of Commons thinks fit to send to them purely and
simply? Certainly they are not; no such thing is expected
of them by any man or any set of men, but common prudence
and a sense of their own condition and their own relative
strength under the new dispensation demand that they
should exercise their undoubted rights with circumspection
and calmness, desisting from all opposition for opposition&rsquo;s
sake, standing out firmly on questions involving great and
important principles, and yielding with a good grace, without
ill-humour, and without subserviency on minor points. They
ought, for example, to have followed in the footsteps of Peel
in this Irish Corporation Bill, and to have satisfied themselves
with making those amendments which he strove for without
success in the House of Commons, and no more. As it is,
he wholly disapproves of the course they have taken, and so
I believe did the Duke of Wellington in the beginning of
the discussions, but Lyndhurst took the lead with the violent
party, overruled the Duke, neglected Peel, and dealt with
the Bill in the slashing manner we have seen.</p>

<p>I was talking to Lord John Russell yesterday at Court on
this subject, and he said that he had no doubt Peel highly
disapproved of their proceedings, and that it was evident he
did not pretend to guide them; for one day in the House of
Commons he went over to Peel, and said that he meant to
recommit (or some such thing, no matter what the particular
course was) the Bill that night, and he supposed he would
not object. Peel said, &lsquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t object,&rsquo; and as he
was going away Peel called him back and said, &lsquo;Remember
I speak only for myself; I can answer for no other individual
in the House.&rsquo; He went out of town about a fortnight ago,
has never returned, and will not; his own friends think he
ought, but it is evident that he prefers to wash his hands of
the matter. He knows well enough that the Conservatives
hate him in their hearts; besides having never cordially forgiven
him for his conduct on the Catholic question, they are
indignant at his Liberal views and opinions, and when they
adopted him as their leader it was in the fond hope that he
would restore the good old days of Tory Government, than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
which nothing could be farther from his thoughts. John
Russell said of him yesterday &lsquo;that he was, in fact, a great
lover of changes and innovations;&rsquo; and so he is. It often
occurs to me that he would not care very much if the House
of Lords did go to the wall, and that though he is the acknowledged
head of the Conservative party, he doesn&rsquo;t in his heart
care much for Conservative principles. He may possibly
calculate that no change can take place in this country by
which property will be menaced; that personally he is safe,
and politically his vast superiority in all the requisites for
public life must, under all possible circumstances, make him
the most eminent performer on the great stage. I do not
know that he has any such thoughts as these, but it appears
to me far from improbable, and the more so from his keeping
aloof at this moment and abstaining (as far as we know)
from any attempt to restrain the indiscretion and impetuosity
of his party.</p>

<p>But if on the one hand the conduct of the Tories with
respect to the Corporation Bill has been violent and rash,
that of the Government with respect to the Tithe Bill has
been unspeakably wicked. I cannot recollect an instance of
so complete a sacrifice of the interests of others, of their
own principles, and of national tranquillity to mere party
objects, and the more I reflect upon the course they have
taken the more profligate and disgraceful it appears. These
Ministers have recorded their opinion that the question of
appropriation ought not to be mixed up with that of commutation;
that they are essentially distinct, and ought to
remain so. At the beginning of this session the united
Whigs and Radicals considered only one thing&mdash;how to
drive Peel out, and though they had a choice of means to
accomplish this end, the famous resolution about appropriation
was the one which they finally selected for the purpose.
In so doing they were altogether regardless of future
consequences,<a name="FNA_29_01" id="FNA_29_01"></a><a href="#FN_29_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and never stopped to calculate what would be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE WHIGS&rsquo; TITHE BILL.</span>
effect of saddling the measure of relief (in which all parties
concurred) with this impossible condition. Now how stands
the case?  They declare that Ireland (as all the world
knows) is a scene of disorder and bloodshed, of which the
Tithe system is the principal cause, and that the Tithe Bill
will afford an effectual remedy to the evil. It is therefore
their imperative and paramount duty, as it ought to be their
earnest and engrossing desire, to secure the application of
their remedy, and, whether in office or out of office (with the
expectation and intention of coming in), to take care that
nothing should be mixed up with it by which it can be endangered,
and that it should be proposed merely for what it
is, and not made subservient to any object but that for
which it has been professedly framed. Having committed
the first error of employing this resolution to drive out the
Government, they then considered themselves obliged to
adopt it as an integral part of the Bill, and accordingly they
did so, with a full knowledge that by so doing they should
ensure the rejection of the Bill itself and that Ireland would
continue in the same state of anarchy and confusion, only
aggravated by the furious contests of parties here and by
the failure of all schemes of remedial legislation. Nothing
can be more certain than this, that if the state of Ireland
had been taken into consideration with the simple, straightforward
view of tranquillising the country, and that no party
object had been mixed up with it, the framers of the Tithe
Bill would sedulously have avoided introducing the appropriation
clause; but during the great battle with Peel the
establishment of this principle (not only the principle of
<i>appropriation</i>, but that <i>no relief</i> should be afforded without
its recognition) was made the condition of Radical support
and the bond of Radical connection, and having as the result
of this compact pledged the House of Commons to the principle,
they refuse to retrace their steps, and offer the House
of Lords the alternative of its recognition (knowing that
they cannot in sincerity, honour, or conscience recognise
it) or that of an irreparable injury to the Irish Church,
which it is the grand object of the Lords to uphold. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the question must not be considered as one merely affecting
the interests of the clergy of Ireland. If that were all,
there might be no such great harm in these proceedings.
Entertaining very strong (and as I think very sound) opinions
with respect to the expediency of dealing with its revenues,
and for purposes ultimately to be effected which they cannot
yet venture to avow, they might be justified, or think themselves
justified, in coping with the difficulties which embarrass
this question in the best mode that is open to them,
and deem it better that the Irish clergy should suffer the
temporary privations they undergo than that the final settlement
of the ecclesiastical question should be indefinitely
postponed. But they do not pretend to be actuated by any
such considerations; their declared object is to restore peace
to Ireland, to terminate the Tithe quarrel, to raise the
Protestant clergy from their fallen state, and to assert the
authority of the law by taking away the inducements which
now exist for setting the law at defiance. Those who undertake
to govern the country are above all things bound to see
that the laws are obeyed, and they do not deserve the name
of a Government if they submit to, much less if they connive
at, a permanent state of anarchy in any part of the
country. They know that the law in Ireland is a dead letter,
that neither to statute nor common law do the lower orders
of Irish Catholics (the bulk of the nation) pay the slightest
obedience, and that they are countenanced and urged on in
their disobedience by those agitators with whom the Government
act in political fellowship, and in deference to whom
their measures have been shaped. Granting that after the
adoption of the resolution by the House of Commons they
were bound to insert it in their Bill, what justification is
there for their refusal to receive the Bill back from the
Lords with no other alteration than the omission of the
appropriation clause? In so refusing they destroy their
own measure; they publish to the world that it is the principle
of appropriation, and not the Tithe composition, that
they really care for; and in thus strangling their own Bill,
because they cannot tack that principle on to it, they make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE WHIGS' TITHE BILL.</span>
themselves accomplices of the outrages and violence which
are perpetrated in the Tithe warfare, and abettors of the
regular and systematic violation of the law. The King&rsquo;s
Government exhibits itself in a conspiracy with Catholic
agitators and Protestant republicans against the clergy of
the Established Church and against the laws of the land.
If they are sincere in their own statements and declarations
they must of necessity deem no object commensurate with
this in point of urgency and importance; and what is the
object to which this is postponed? That of maintaining
their own consistency; because they turned the late Government
out on this question they must now adhere to it with
desperate tenacity; their interests as a party demand that
they should; O&rsquo;Connell and the Radicals will not forgive
them if they give it up. They might if they would declare
their unchanged opinion in favour of the principle of appropriation,
and their determination to press the adoption of
it at all times and by all means, and never to desist till
they had accomplished its recognition, but at the same time
announce that the perilous state of Ireland&mdash;the magnitude
of the evil resulting from the Tithe system&mdash;would not allow
them to reject the Tithe Bill though denuded of the appropriation
clauses, as all the rest of its provisions (all those by
which the Tithe system was to be determined) had been
passed by the Lords. I cannot conceive how a conscientious
Minister can take upon himself the responsibility of quashing
this measure, and contentedly look forward to the probability&mdash;almost
certainty&mdash;of a fresh course of outrage and
disorder, and a new catalogue of miseries and privations,
which he all the time believes it is in his power to avert.
But these Ministers think that they could not avert these
evils (by accepting the Bill) without giving umbrage to their
task-masters and allies, and they do not scruple to sacrifice
the mighty interests at stake in Ireland to the paltry and
ephemeral interests of their party&mdash;interests which cannot
outlive the present hour and party, which the slightest
change in the political atmosphere may sweep away in an
instant. There is also another reason by which they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
determined; they cannot face the accusation of inconsistency&mdash;the
question that would be put, Why did you
turn out Peel&rsquo;s Government? You turned him out on this
very principle which you are now ready to abandon. There
is no doubt that this question would be put with a very
triumphant air by their opponents, but they might easily
answer it, without admitting in so many words&mdash;what everybody
well knows without any admission&mdash;that the resolution
was brought forward for the express purpose of turning Peel
out. They might say that they moved that resolution because
it is a principle that they wished to establish, and that
they still think ought to be established; that Peel&rsquo;s resignation
on that particular question was of his own choice, and
that if they are not irrevocably bound by the resolution itself,
they are not the more bound by that circumstance; that they
sent the Bill to the House of Lords in what they consider
the best form, but that after the Lords had agreed to the
whole measure, with the exception of the appropriation
clauses, it was their duty to take the matter again into their
serious consideration, and to determine whether it was on
the whole more advantageous to Ireland and to the Empire
that the Bill should be rejected (with all the consequences
of its rejection apparent) or that it should be passed without
these clauses. There was no necessity for their abandonment
of any opinion or principle, nor any obstacle to the
appropriation clauses being brought forward again and again
in a substantive independent shape. Besides this, it is not
pretended that these clauses were to produce any immediate
perhaps not even any remote, effect, and they not only
acknowledge that the state of Ireland calls for an immediate
remedy, but they assert that unless the remedy is applied
without loss of time it will come too late; that the Tithe
Bill, which this year would accomplish its object, will in all
probability next year be wholly inoperative. To my mind
this reasoning is so conclusive that I can come to no other
than the harsh judgment which I have passed upon their
conduct, and I think I have made good my charges against
both Whigs and Tories.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_29_01" id="FN_29_01"></a><a href="#FNA_29_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
The Whigs were not, probably, the Radicals. O&rsquo;Connell, without
doubt, had very good reasons for pinning the Government to this, and foresaw
all the consequences of the compact by which he bound them.</p></div>

<span class="pagehead">ALTERCATION IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
The House of Lords has become a beargarden
since Brougham has been in it; there is no night that
is not distinguished by some violent squabble between him
and the Tories. Lord Winchelsea directly accused him of
cowardice the night before last, to which he replied, &lsquo;As to
my being <i>afraid</i> to say elsewhere what I say here, oh, that is
too absurd to require an answer.&rsquo; It is nevertheless true.
Melbourne does very well; his memory served him happily
on this night. Brougham had lashed the Lords into a fury
by calling them a <i>mob</i>, and Melbourne quoted Lord Chesterfield,
who said that <i>all</i> deliberative assemblies were <i>mobs</i>.
The other day Lord Howick was inveighing passionately
against the Lords for their mutilations of the Corporation
Bill, when Melbourne said, with his characteristic <i>nonchalance</i>,
&lsquo;Why, what does it matter? We have gone on tolerably
well for 500 years with these corporations, and we may contrive
to go on with them for another year or so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the King&rsquo;s birthday his Majesty had Lord Lansdowne
and Lord Melbourne to dine with him at Windsor, and he
made some extraordinary speeches, of which various versions
are about the town. By-the-bye, I was turning over the
&lsquo;Annual Register&rsquo; the other day, and hit upon his speech
last year to the bishops, and I was astonished at the eloquence
of it. It is said that Phillpotts composed it for him,
but there are some internal marks of its emanating from
himself. It is certainly remarkably good of the kind, and I
think it more probable that he spoke what he thought and
felt, and that Phillpotts reported it and made the best of it.</p>

<h3>September 1st, 1835</h3>

<p>Lord John Russell assembled his Whigs
and Radicals at the Foreign Office yesterday morning, and
announced to them the course he proposed to adopt with
regard to the Corporation Bill, the amendments he would
accept, those he would modify, and those he would decline.
Hume made a violent speech, deprecating any concessions,
but O&rsquo;Connell made a very moderate one, recommending a
compromise, and saying that great alarm prevailed among
many well-meaning and conscientious persons lest Reform
should proceed too far; that it was highly expedient to quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
these apprehensions, and upon every account therefore he
recommended a moderate and conciliatory course. There
were between two and three hundred present at this meeting.
Accordingly in the afternoon John Russell stated over again
in the House of Commons pretty much what he had said in
the morning, and made a very temperate and conciliatory
speech. Peel, who had arrived suddenly and unexpectedly
in town,<a name="FNA_29_02" id="FNA_29_02"></a><a href="#FN_29_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
rose after him, and, as everybody said (some with
joy, others with rage), &lsquo;threw over the Lords.&rsquo; He declared
his concurrence in those amendments which John Russell
agreed to, and his acquiescence in most of the other provisions
without the amendments of the Lords; to the aldermen
for life he objected, and to some other particulars, as
his speech shows. The only amendment to which he subscribed
(and that was objected to by Government) was the
exclusion of Dissenters from the disposal of Church patronage,
and I was very much surprised to hear him stand out
for this upon (as I think) very insufficient grounds. Nothing
could exceed the dismay and the rage (though suppressed)
of the Conservatives at his speech. He was not a bit cheered
by those behind him, but very heartily by those opposite.
One silly, noisy fellow, whose principal vocation in the House
of Commons is to bellow, came near me under the gallery, and
I asked him why they did not cheer, when he sulkily answered,
&lsquo;he was so well cheered by the other side that it was not necessary.&rsquo;
Lord Harrowby was under the gallery. I asked him
what he said to Peel&rsquo;s speech. &lsquo;I did not hear it,&rsquo; he tartly
replied, &lsquo;but he seems to have given up the aldermen. I have
a great affection for the aldermen.&rsquo; At the &lsquo;Travellers&rsquo; I met
Strangford, and asked him the same question. He said, &lsquo;I
say, Not content.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you must take the Bill.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Not I, for one; the Lords cannot take it, and if we are to
be ruined I think we had better be ruined by real Radicals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PEEL&rsquo;S CONCILIATORY CONDUCT.</span>
than by sham Tories.&rsquo; Afterwards I saw Lord Londonderry,
who talked in the same strain, not denying that the Duke of
Wellington had unwillingly come into the measures which
Lyndhurst had adopted, but talking of Lyndhurst&rsquo;s Conservative
scruples as a constitutional lawyer, and such stuff as
this. The manner in which the Duke has been ousted from
the leadership, and the alacrity with which the Lords have
followed Lyndhurst, because he led them into violent courses,
is not the least curious part of this business. (It seems
they only meant to make Lyndhurst their leader <i>pro hac
vice</i>.)</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_29_02" id="FN_29_02"></a><a href="#FNA_29_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Peel gave no notice of his intention to come to town. Hardinge, who is
more intimate with him than most of his political associates, was so sure he
would not come that he told Bradshaw, who asked him, that he certainly
would not be here, and that he (Bradshaw) might go into the country when
he pleased.</p></div>

<p>Bingham Baring and I walked away together, and I went
with him to Lord Ashburton&rsquo;s house, who was not a little
astonished at what we told him, and asserted that Peel was
quite wrong about the aldermen. The violent Whigs were
rather provoked at the turn things took, and Howick, whom
I saw under the gallery, said with great bitterness (mixed
with pleasure at Peel&rsquo;s abandonment of the Lords) that he,
for one, &lsquo;only consented to these alterations, which made the
Bill so much worse, with a view to obtain future compensation,
and <i>with interest</i>.&rsquo; The English Radicals were very
indignant, and Hume, Grote, and Roebuck spoke one after
another against the Government concessions, but there was
no disposition to listen to them, and an evident satisfaction
at the prospect of an amicable termination of the rising
dispute. Nobody apprehends any other termination, for
though the Lords will bluster, and fume, and fret, and there
will be no small fermentation of mortified pride and vanity,
there must be some difference of opinion at least, and the
Duke of Wellington is quite sure to exert his influence to
bring the majority to adopt Peel&rsquo;s views. It has always
been considered by the Tories an object of paramount importance
to keep their party together (this was the pretext
of Wharncliffe and Harrowby for joining in that fatal postponement
of Schedule A), and if after Peel&rsquo;s speech they
were to refuse to accept the fair compromise which is tendered
to them, it is impossible to suppose that he would consider
himself as belonging to them, or that they could pretend to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
acknowledge him as their leader, and the Tory party would
by this schism be effectually broken up.</p>

<p>I have long considered the breaking up of the Tory
party as a grand desideratum, and though I earnestly desire
to see a powerful Conservative party in the country and in
Parliament, it must be one reconstructed out of materials more
various and more Liberal than that which now calls itself
Conservative, but which in its heart clings to the narrow
notions and loves the exclusive system of bygone days. The
dissolution of the Tory party in the House of Lords, by a division
of them into a high and a low section, would in itself be
a reform of that House, and it is to such a dissolution and
fresh modification of parties that we must look for a reform,
which without any violent change will redress the balance and
enable the machine of government to move without obstruction.
I sat next to Senior in the House of Lords, and he was
talking of the necessity of a reform of the House of Peers,
and he said, &lsquo;I can see the steps of it very plainly.&rsquo; &lsquo;What,
by making Peers for life, as you suggest in your pamphlet?&rsquo;
&lsquo;No, it is too late for that now, but by the election of representatives.
When Scotland was united she sent representative
Peers elected from the body; Ireland the same. Now
fifty years of Tory rule have given such a preponderance to
the Tory interest in the House of Lords, that the balance
cannot be redressed but by a creation which would make
the House of Peers too numerous for a legislative assembly.
I would therefore begin by creating, in order to equalise the
strength of the opposite parties, and then the Peers should
elect representatives.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;All this will be unnecessary,
for the Tory party will be broken up, and without a change so
startling and extensive the balance will be quietly redressed,
and in the natural order of things.&rsquo; The Duc de Nemours
was under the gallery in the House of Commons, but he
soon went away, and in the middle of Peel&rsquo;s speech.</p>

<h3>September 3rd, 1835</h3>

<p>Nothing could be better than the temper
and disposition of the House on Tuesday night, as well as
on Monday, nothing more flattering to Peel. John Russell
said &lsquo;he was anxious that the clause (I forget which) should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RECONCILIATION.</span>
go forth with the sanction of the right honourable baronet&rsquo;s
approbation.&rsquo; Peel said he spoke only for himself; Lord John
said that made no difference, indicating in fact that his opinion
was worth more than those of all his followers put together.
The Lords in the meantime are tremendously sulky, and
though it is impossible to believe they will have the frantic
folly to refuse the accommodation that by God&rsquo;s mercy is
offered to them, it is not quite safe, and they are now in
grand conclave at Apsley House to determine upon their
course. Lord Lansdowne told me at Court yesterday that the
day before he went up to Lyndhurst in the House of Lords,
to speak to him about some Bill, when Lyndhurst said, &lsquo;I
was in hopes you were coming to speak to me about the
amendments.&rsquo; &lsquo;No; it will be time enough to talk about
them when they are again before the House.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, and
what do they say now?&rsquo; &lsquo;They say that the lives of your
aldermen are not at a premium.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do they? But they
will rise in the market to-morrow, I can tell you.&rsquo; What
satisfies me most in all this is the conduct of the Government,
and even that of many of the Radicals&mdash;of Hume, for
instance&mdash;and the general temper and disposition evinced by
the House, symptomatic of a more healthy feeling than I
ever expected to see displayed. In the division the Radical
numbers were contemptible, showing that the Conservative
interest, if not broken up by party divisions, and if ever it
was roused and connected by the acknowledgment of a
common danger, would crush the Radical force in an instant.
These are valuable manifestations, and worth a hundred
clauses in the Corporation Bill; for what matters it whether
aldermen and town clerks are perpetuated or suppressed?
and it really is grotesque to fight for these puerilities as if
it was a contest <i>pro aris et focis</i>, and to hesitate one instant
whether a collision should be provoked between the two
Houses of Parliament, and the advantages both direct and
collateral flowing from Peel&rsquo;s mediation be thrown away,
for the sake of maintaining these secondary and questionable
objects.</p>

<h3>September 6th, 1835</h3>

<p>On Thursday there was a great meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
at Apsley House; eighty Peers present, and four hours&rsquo; deliberation.
They kept their resolutions a profound secret,
but as I knew what they were on Friday morning, I went
to Melbourne and told him, in order that the Government
might be prepared, and turn over in their minds how matters
might be accommodated. The Tories adhered to the justices
and wards, and abandoned the rest. I found Melbourne and
Lord John together; the latter said there would be no difficulty
about the justices, but the amendment about the wards
was impossible.</p>

<p>The debate at night was carried on with extraordinary
temper and calmness; Brougham complimented Lyndhurst
in very glowing terms. The matter now stands over till
Monday, when the Commons must determine whether to
accept the Bill with these alterations or reject it on account
of them. There is great division of opinion as to the
result, but I cannot bring myself to believe that they will
let the Bill drop for such trifles. I asked Wharncliffe last
night to explain to me in what manner these things would
operate <i>politically</i>, and he owned that he thought their
political importance was greatly overrated, but that the
division proposed by Government gave greater influence to
numbers, while that substituted by the Peers gave more to property,
and that the constitution of the town councils, whether
they were more or less Radical or Conservative, would have
a political effect in this way; that in every borough little
democracies would be established, which would be continually
exercising a democratic influence and extending
democratic principles, and that the greater the infusion of
Conservative interest you could make in these new bodies
the more that tendency would be counteracted. In my
opinion a fallacy lurks under this argument; they assume
the certain democratic, even revolutionary, character of the
new town councils without any sufficient reason, but if this
be so, and if they are correct in their anticipations, I doubt
whether the guards and drawbacks with which they are
endeavouring to counteract the pernicious influence they
dread will be found efficacious. I do not despair of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">EFFECTS OF MUNICIPAL REFORM.</span>
prevalence of sound Conservative principles <i>upon a Liberal
basis</i>, and it appears to me that the Peers have committed
a great blunder in expressing such violent suspicion and
distrust of the new corporations; that nothing is so likely
to make them Radical as to insist that they must and will be
so, or to render them inimical to the aristocracy and to aristocratic
institutions as to exhibit a violent hostility on the part
of the aristocracy towards them. I apply this observation
generally to their way of dealing with the question rather than
to the particular words of the disputed clause, which is probably
on the whole fairer and better as the Peers amended it
than as the Commons framed it, so much so that I do not
understand the tenacity with which the Government cling
to it. One thing is very clear, that neither for this nor for
the justices clause is it worth while (to either party) that the
prevailing harmony should be broken and the Bill be lost. If
both parties were sincerely desirous of an accommodation,
and there was any common interest, any common ground on
which they could meet, there would be no difficulty in an adjustment;
but this is not the case. Not only are the interests
and wishes of the two parties at variance, but the desires of
the moderate and the violent in each party are so too. The
moderate in both probably do wish for an accommodation.
The Bill is the Bill of the Whigs, and with all the amendments
it does in point of fact accomplish their object,
though not, as Lyndhurst said, so completely as without
them. They wish the Bill to pass, therefore, but the Tories
detest the Bill even as it is, and it is no concern of theirs
<i>quoad Bill</i> that it should pass; on the contrary, they would
rejoice at its failure, but its failure would place the two
Houses in a state of collision, and though each party would
throw the blame on the other (on very plausible grounds
either way), it is more the interest of the Lords than of the
Commons to avert this, because the danger of collision attaches
exclusively to the Lords. The violent of the Commons would
rather like it; the violent of the Lords would doggedly encounter
it. There are many who desire that the dispute
should not be settled, in order to push matters to extremities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and involve the Houses in a contest, in order to extirpate
the House of Lords. What renders it more desirable on
account of the Lords that the Bill should not be lost, and
a cry got up against them, is the circumstance of their
having thrown out so many other Bills, and some on very
unjustifiable grounds&mdash;the Dublin Police Bill, for example.
Not a word was said against its merits; on the contrary, it
was not denied that the case was urgent, and it was only
thrown out because the Lord Mayor and Corporation of
Dublin had not been consulted. Now it might have been
very proper to consult these functionaries; it may even be
a culpable omission to have neglected them; but this is not
a time, nor is the House of Lords in circumstances, to be so
fastidious and to stickle for such formalities. Their character
with the nation is at stake, and it is of far greater
consequence that they should do nothing calculated to throw
suspicion on their motives, or odium on their proceedings,
than to provide for a punctilious observance of respect and
deference to the Dublin Corporation. They seem to me to
have made a great mistake in throwing out this Bill, and
I am much deceived if they do not hear more of it hereafter.</p>

<h3>September 8th, 1835</h3>

<p>Lord John called another meeting at the
Foreign Office yesterday morning, when he proposed, and
they agreed to take the Lords&rsquo; amendments and finish the
business; so this famous Corporation Bill has got through
at last. O&rsquo;Connell and Warburton concurred in accepting
it. The only man who violently opposed its being accepted
was Tom Duncombe, who made a furious harangue, and
boldly asserted that <i>he knew</i> to a positive certainty that if
the Commons would hold out the Peers would abandon the
justices and wards, and he offered <i>privately</i> to give John
Russell a list of Peers sufficient to carry this, and who, he
would answer for it, were ready to make the concession.
Lord John, however, was too wise to listen to such impudent
nonsense, and, though very reluctantly, it was settled that
the Commons should give way. Both parties probably overrate
the value of the disputed clauses, and it is to be regretted
that the two Houses will not part <i>amicably</i>. Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S HARANGUE ON THE MILITIA.</span>
takes the Bill under a sort of engagement to consider it as
an instalment, and that they shall try and get the difference
next year. This is mere humbug, and a poor sop thrown
to the Radicals, but as it answers the immediate purpose it
is very well.</p>

<h3>September 9th, 1835</h3>

<p>To-day at Court, when his Majesty made
one of his most extraordinary harangues, and much more
lengthy than usual. It was evidently got up with great care
and previous determination. The last article on the Council
list was one for the reduction of the militia, and it was upon
this that he descanted with great vehemence. He gave a historical
account of the militia from the year 1756, when he
said it was increased against the inclination of George II.,
who was not so well acquainted with the country as his
successors have been, &lsquo;when there was a Whig Administration,
as there is now.&rsquo; He declared his conviction that
the safety of the country demanded a numerous and effective
militia, that nothing should have induced him to consent to
the present reduction but the necessity of making some
changes which had become indispensable owing to the culpable
conduct of colonels of the militia who had neglected
their duty, but whose names he would not expose; that
agitators in Ireland and political economists here wished to
reduce this force, in order, under the pretext of economy, to
leave the country defenceless; but he never would consent
to this, and only agreed to the present measure upon a clear
understanding that early in the next session the matter was
to be brought forward in Parliament with a view to render
the militia more efficient; that nothing but the militia
justified the smallness of our military establishments as
compared with those of other nations; and he finished by
saying that the state of our relations with Russia made the
maintenance of this force of paramount importance, as it
was impossible to say what dangers we might not be menaced
with from that quarter, or how soon we might be called
upon to face them, and that the advisers of the Crown would
incur a deep responsibility if any mischief arose from the
undue reduction of this force. He ended a very long speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
(of which I can only put down an outline) with this strange
denunciation against Russia, and then said, &lsquo;One word
more. I have spoken thus in the presence of many
Lords who are connected with the militia, either immediately
or through their friends, because I wish that my sentiments
should be thoroughly and extensively promulgated.&rsquo; This
is a very brief outline of his oration, which was delivered
with great energy.</p>

<p>At the levee I had some talk with Hobhouse, who expressed
himself well satisfied with the termination of the
Corporation contest; he said that the King was delighted, and
added (in which I think he flatters himself) that he was in
high good-humour in consequence, and that though he disliked
them politically, he liked them very well personally,
and that if the Irish Church question could be arranged, he
would be quite content with them, and they should be excellent
friends.</p>

<p>Lord Howick, who is the bitterest of all that party, and expresses
himself with astonishing acrimony, talked in his
usual strain, and I could not refrain from giving him a bit
of my mind. He talked of &lsquo;the Lords having played their
last trump,&rsquo; of &lsquo;the impossibility of their going on, of the
hostility towards them in the country, and the manner in
which suggestions of reforming the House of Lords were
received in the House of Commons,&rsquo; and expressed his conviction
that &lsquo;that House as an institution was in imminent
danger.&rsquo; I told him I did not believe that such sentiments
pervaded the country, that I had not yet seen sufficient evidence
of it, and asked if such a spirit really was in activity,
did he not think he was bound to set about resisting and
counteracting it? He talked of &lsquo;its not being resistible;&rsquo; he
said that &lsquo;the Lords must give way or a collision would be the
consequence,&rsquo; and &lsquo;he knew who would go to the wall.&rsquo; I
said that &lsquo;it was such sentiments as those, uttered by such
men as himself, which most contributed to create the danger
the existence of which he deplored.&rsquo; To this he made no
answer; but who can feel secure when a Minister of the
Crown, in the palace of the King, within three yards of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING AND THE DUCHESS OF KENT.</span>
person, while he is there present exercising the functions of
royalty, holds language the most revolutionary, and such as
might more naturally be uttered at some low meeting in
St. Giles&rsquo;s or St. Pancras&rsquo; than in such a place? In spite of
my disposition to be sanguine, it is impossible to shake off
all alarm when I hear the opinions of men of different
parties (opinions founded on different data and biassed by
opposite wishes) meeting at the same point, and arriving by
different roads at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Lyndhurst (who called on me the day before yesterday
about some business) talked over the Corporation Bill, which
he considers to be nearly as important as the Reform Bill.
He says it must give them all the corporate boroughs, for he
assumes as an undoubted fact that the new councils will be
Radical, and that their influence will radicalise the boroughs.
He said there was no chance of the House of Lords surviving
ten years, that power must reside in the House of Commons,
as it always had, and that the House of Commons would not
endure the independent authority of the other House; so that
Howick and Lyndhurst are not far apart in their calculations.
It is certainly true, what Lyndhurst said to me the other day
in George Street, that &lsquo;they know the Bill accomplishes
their purpose.&rsquo; Melbourne said to me at Court that &lsquo;it was
a great <i>bouleversement</i>, a great experiment, and we must see
how it worked.&rsquo; I met him in St. James&rsquo;s Park afterwards,
and walked with him to the Palace. He told me the King
was in a state of great excitement, especially about this
militia question, but that the thing which affected him most
was the conduct of the Duchess of Kent&mdash;her popularity-hunting,
her progresses, and above all the addresses which
she received and replied to. He told me what the King
had said at dinner on his birthday about her. &lsquo;I cannot
expect to live very long, but I hope that my successor may
be of full age when she mounts the throne. I have great
respect for the person upon whom, in the event of my death,
the Regency would devolve, but I have great distrust of the
persons by whom she is surrounded. I know that everything
which falls from my lips is reported again, and I say this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
thus candidly and publicly because it is my desire and intention
that these my sentiments should be made known.&rsquo;
Melbourne told me that he believed Lord Durham is not in
favour with the Duchess of Kent, who has discovered that
he had made use of her for his own ends, and she has now
withdrawn her confidence from him. I asked him who her
confidants were, but he either did not know or would not
tell me.</p>

<h3>Doncaster, September 15th, 1835</h3>

<p>Left London on Saturday
morning with Matuscewitz; I had a good deal of conversation
with him about the state and prospects of this country, in
the course of which he told me that Louis Philippe had
consulted Talleyrand about the maintenance of his intimate
connection with England, and that Talleyrand had replied,
&lsquo;When you came to the throne four years ago, I advised you
to cultivate your relations with England as the best security
you could obtain. I now advise you to relinquish that
connection, for in the present state of English politics it can
only be productive of danger or embarrassment to you.&rsquo;
Having omitted to put it down at the time, I can&rsquo;t recollect
the exact words, but this was the sense, and <i>I think</i> Matuscewitz
said that Louis Philippe had told him this himself.</p>

<p>We dined at Burghley on the way, and got here at two on
Sunday; read Mackintosh&rsquo;s Life in the carriage, which made
me dreadfully disgusted with my racing <i>métier</i>. What a life
as compared with mine!&mdash;passed among great and wise men,
and intent on high thoughts and honourable aspirations,
existing amidst interests far more pungent even than those
which engage me, and of the futility of which I am for ever
reminded. I am struck with the coincidence of the tastes
and dispositions of Burke and Mackintosh, and of something
in the mind of the one which bears an affinity to that of the
other; but their characters&mdash;how different! their abilities&mdash;how
unequal! yet both, how superior, even the weakest of
the two, to almost all other men, and the success of each so
little corresponding with his powers, neither having ever
attained any object of ambition beyond that of fame. All
their talents, therefore, and all their requirements, did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PRINCESS VICTORIA AT BURGHLEY.</span>
procure them content, and probably Burke was a very unhappy,
and Mackintosh not a very happy, man. The suavity,
the indolent temperament, the &lsquo;mitis sapientia&rsquo; of Mackintosh
may have warded off sorrow and mitigated disappointment,
but the stern and vindictive energies of Burke must have
kept up a storm of conflicting passions in his breast. But I
turn from Mackintosh and Burke to all that is vilest and
foolishest on earth, and among such I now pass my unprofitable
hours. There seems to me less gaiety and bustle here
than formerly, but as much villany as ever. From want of
money or of enterprise, or from greater distrust and a paucity
of spectators, there is very little betting, and what there is,
spiritless and dull. There are vast crowds of people to see
the Princess Victoria, who comes over from Wentworth to-day,
and the Due de Nemours is here. I am going to run
for the St. Leger, which I shall probably not win, and though
I am nervous and excited, I shall not care much if I lose, and
I doubt whether I should care very much if I won; but this
latter sensation will probably be for ever doubtful. There is
something in it all which displeases me, and I often wish I
was well out of it.</p>

<h3>Burghley, September 21st, 1835</h3>

<p>I did lose the St. Leger, and
did not care; idled on at Doncaster to the end of the week,
and came here on Saturday to meet the Duchess of Kent.
They arrived from Belvoir at three o&rsquo;clock in a heavy rain,
the civic authorities having turned out at Stamford to escort
them, and a procession of different people all very loyal.
When they had lunched, and the Mayor and his brethren
had got dry, the Duchess received the address, which was
read by Lord Exeter as Recorder. It talked of the Princess
as &lsquo;destined to mount the throne of these realms.&rsquo; Conroy
handed the answer, just as the Prime Minister does to the
King. They are splendidly lodged, and great preparations
have been made for their reception.</p>

<h3>London, September 27th, 1835</h3>

<p>The dinner at Burghley was
very handsome; hall well lit; and all went off well, except
that a pail of ice was landed in the Duchess&rsquo;s lap, which made
a great bustle. Three hundred people at the ball, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
opened by Lord Exeter and the Princess, who, after dancing
one dance, went to bed. They appeared at breakfast the
next morning at nine o&rsquo;clock, and at ten set off to Holkham.
Went to Newmarket on Tuesday and came to town on
Wednesday; found it very empty and no news. Lord Chatham
died the day before yesterday, which is of no other
importance than that of giving some honours and emoluments
to Melbourne to distribute.</p>

<p>The papers are full of nothing but O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s progress
in Scotland, where he is received with unbounded enthusiasm
by enormous crowds, but by no people of rank, property, or
character. It is a rabble triumph altogether, but it is made
the most of by all the Ministerial papers. The Opposition
papers pour torrents of invective upon him, and he in his
speeches is not behindhand with the most virulent and
scurrilous of them; he is exalted to the bad eminence at
which he has arrived more by the assaults of his enemies
than by the efforts of his friends. It is the Tories who are
ever insisting upon the immensity of his power, and whose
excess of hatred and fear make him of such vast account
that &lsquo;he draws the rabble after him as a monster makes a
show.&rsquo; However mean may be his audiences in Scotland,
he has numbers to boast of, and that will serve his purpose;
he will no doubt render this reception instrumental to the
increase of his authority in Ireland. He now avows that
he has abandoned Repeal, and all other projects, in order to
devote himself to the great task of reforming the House of
Lords.</p>

<p>I have finished Mackintosh&rsquo;s Life with great delight, and
many painful sensations, together with wonder and amazement.
His account of his reading is utterly incomprehensible
to me; he must have been endowed with some superhuman
faculty of transferring the contents of books to his
own mind. He talks in his journals of reading volumes in
a few hours which would seem to demand many days even
from the most rapid reader. I have heard of Southey, who
would read a book through as he stood in a bookseller&rsquo;s shop;
that is, his eye would glance down the page, and by a process
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH.</span>
partly mechanical, partly intellectual, formed by long
habit, he would extract in his synoptical passage all that he
required to know. (Macaulay was, and George Lewis is,
just as wonderful in this respect.) Some of the books that
Mackintosh talks of, philosophical and metaphysical works,
could not be so disposed of, and I should like much to know
what his system or his secret was. I met Sydney Smith
yesterday, and asked him why more of the journals had not
been given. He said because the editors had been ill advised,
but that in another edition more should be given; that
Mackintosh was the most agreeable man he had ever known,
that he had been shamefully used by his friends, and by none
more than by Brougham. So, I said, it would appear by
what you say in your letter. &lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; he said, laughing and
chuckling, and shaking his great belly, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t really
think I meant to allude to Brougham?&rsquo; &lsquo;Mackintosh&rsquo;s son,&rsquo;
he said &lsquo;is a man of no talents, the composition (what there
is of it) belongs to Erskine, his son-in-law, a sensible man.&rsquo;
To be sure there are some strange things said by Mackintosh
here and there; among others, that Lord Holland only
wanted voice&mdash;not to be impeded in his utterance&mdash;to be a
greater orator than Canning or Brougham! If he had not
been a man &lsquo;whom no sense of wrongs could rouse to vengeance,&rsquo;
he would have flung the India Board in Lord Grey&rsquo;s
face when he was insulted with the offer of
it.<a name="FNA_29_03" id="FNA_29_03"></a><a href="#FN_29_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
What are
we to think of the necessary connection between intellectual
superiority and official eminence, when we have seen the
Duke of Richmond invited to be a member of the Cabinet,
while Mackintosh was thrust into an obscure and subordinate
office&mdash;Mackintosh placed under the orders of Charles Grant!
Well might he regret that he had not been a professor, and,
&lsquo;with safer pride content,&rsquo; adorned with unusual glory some
academical chair. Then while he was instructing and delighting
the world, there would have been many regrets and
lamentations that such mighty talents were confined to such
a narrow sphere, and innumerable speculations of the greatness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
he would have achieved in political life, and how the
irresistible force of his genius and his eloquence must have
raised him to the pinnacle of Parliamentary fame and political
power. Perhaps he would have partaken in this delusion,
and have bitterly lamented the success which had deprived
him of a more brilliant fortune and a loftier fame; for it may
reasonably be doubted whether all his laborious investigations
of the deepest recesses of the human mind, and his
extensive acquaintance with the theory of mental phenomena,
would have enabled him accurately to ascertain the practical
capabilities of his own mind, and to arrive at those just
conclusions which should indicate to him that path of life
on which it was most expedient for him to travel, with
reference to the strength of his understanding, and the
softness, not to say feebleness, of his character.</p>

<h3>November 17th, 1835</h3>

<p>Since I have been in London, on my
return from the Newmarket meetings, I have had nothing
to note. The O&rsquo;Connell and Raphael wrangle goes on, and
will probably come before Parliament. It appears to make
a greater sensation at Paris than here; there, however, all
other sensations are absorbed in that which the Emperor of
Russia&rsquo;s speech at Warsaw has produced, and which indicates
an excitement, or ferocity, very like
insanity.<a name="FNA_30_01" id="FNA_30_01"></a><a href="#FN_30_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Melbourne
mentioned at dinner on Sunday that it was not only quite
correctly reported&mdash;rather <i>under</i>stated&mdash;but that after he had
so delivered himself, he met the English Consul in the street,
took him by the arm, walked about with him for an hour,
and begged him not to be <i>too hard</i> upon him in his report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to his Government. I was not present, but Henry de Ros
was, who told it me. I am thus particular from, as it seems
to me, the exceeding curiosity of the anecdote, evincing on
the part of the autocrat, in the midst of the insolence of
unbridled power, a sort of consciousness of responsibility to
European opinion, and a deferential dread of that of England
in particular.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_30_01" id="FN_30_01"></a><a href="#FNA_30_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[This was the first time the Emperor Nicholas had visited Poland
since the Revolution of 1830, and he took the opportunity to express himself
in language of excessive severity to the municipality of Warsaw,
threatening to lay the city in ruins if the Poles rebelled again.]</p></div>

<h3>November 22nd, 1835</h3>

<p>My brother Algy showed me a few days
ago a letter from the Duke of Wellington to the Duke of
Cumberland&mdash;a gossiping letter about nothing, but in which
there was this which struck me as odd. He said that he was
informed that the English who had been to the reviews at
Kalisch had been very ill received, and that even those to
whom <i>he</i> had given letters of introduction had experienced
nothing but incivility, and that he regretted having had the
presumption to imagine that any recommendation of his
would be attended to by the Sovereigns or their Ministers&mdash;a
curious exhibition of pique, for what I believe to be an
imaginary incivility. It is a strange thing that he is very
sensitive, and yet has no strong feelings; but this is after all
only one of the forms of selfishness.</p>

<p>Burdett has written a letter to the managers of Brooks&rsquo;s,
to propose the expulsion of O&rsquo;Connell. It will do no good;
these abortive attempts do nothing towards plucking him
down from his bad eminence, and their failure gives him a
triumph. So it was in Alvanley&rsquo;s case; there a great deal
of very proper indignation was thrown away, and O&rsquo;Connell
had the satisfaction of baffling his antagonists, and obtaining
a sort of recognition of his assumed right to act as he does.
It is a case which admits of a good argument either way.
On the one side is the perilous example of any club taking
cognizance of acts of its members, private or political, which
do not concern the club, or have no local reference to it&mdash;a
principle, if once admitted, of which it would be next to impossible
to regulate and control the application, and probably
be productive of greater evils than those it would be intended
to remedy. On the other hand, the case of O&rsquo;Connell is
altogether peculiar; it is such a one as can hardly ever occur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SOCIAL LAW.</span>
again, and therefore may be treated as deserving an exception
from ordinary rules, because it not only cannot be drawn
into a precedent, but the very circumstance of its being so
treated must prevent the possibility of its recurrence. There
exists a code of social law, which is universally subscribed
to, as necessary and indispensable for the preservation of
social harmony and decorum. One man has given public
notice that he is self-emancipated from its obligations; that
he acknowledges none of the restraints, and will submit to
none of the penalties, by which the intercourse of society is
regulated and kept in order; and having thus surrounded
himself with all the immunities of irresponsibility, &lsquo;out of
the reach of danger he is bold, out of the reach of shame he
is confident.&rsquo; Instead of feeling that he is specially bound
to guard his language with the most scrupulous care, and
to abstain religiously from every offensive expression, he
mounts into regions of scurrility and abuse inaccessible to
all other men, and he riots in invective and insult with a
scornful and ostentatious exhibition of his invulnerability,
which renders him an object of execration to all those who
cherish the principles and the feelings of honour.</p>

<h3>November 29th, 1835</h3>

<p>There are gloomy letters from George
Villiers at Madrid; he attributes the Spanish difficulties
more to the conduct of Louis Philippe than anything else,
who, he says, is playing false diabolically. Mendizabal is very
able, but ill surrounded; no other public man of any merit.
Parties are violent and individuals foolish, mischievous, and
corrupt; the country poor, depopulated, ignorant&mdash;out of
such elements what good can come? His letters (to his
mother and brothers) are very interesting, very well written,
clever, lively; he seems a little carried away by the vanity
and the excitement of the part he plays, and I observe
a want of steadiness in his opinions and a disposition to
waver in his views from day to day; whereas it does not
appear to me as if the state of Spain depended upon diurnal
circumstances and events, but more upon the workings
of great causes interwoven with, and deeply seated in, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
<i>positive</i> state of society and the moral and political condition
of the nation.</p>

<h3>December 4th, 1835</h3>

<p>A letter I wrote the other day about
O&rsquo;Connell appeared on Tuesday in the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo; It rather
took, for the evening (Tory) papers all copied it, and I heard
it was talked of. Yesterday there appeared an answer of
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s to Burdett&rsquo;s letter&mdash;very short, but very clever;
and those who know Burdett say, well calculated to mortify
and annoy him. I called on Stanley yesterday, who said
that he thought the Raphael case ought to and would be made
something of in the House of Commons, and that Spring
Rice, whom he had lately seen, had told him he thought it
a clear case of bribery. Lord Segrave has got the Gloucestershire
Lieutenancy, and this appointment, disgraceful in
itself, exhibits all the most objectionable features of the old
boroughmongering system, which was supposed to be swept
away. (He turned out a good Lord-Lieutenant.) He was
in London as soon as the breath was out of the Duke of
Beaufort&rsquo;s body, went to Melbourne, and claimed this appointment
on the score of having three members, which was
more than any other man in England now returned. &lsquo;My
brothers,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the electors do not know by sight; it is
my influence which returns them.&rsquo; The appeal was irresistible,
and &lsquo;We are three&rsquo; was as imperative with Melbourne
as &lsquo;We are seven&rsquo; was with the Duke of Newcastle.
The scarcity of the commodity enhances its value, and now
that nominations are swept away, the few who are still
fortunate enough to possess some remnants are great men;
and Segrave&rsquo;s three brothers, thrown (as they would without
scruple have been) into the opposite scale, would have nearly
turned it. There is a very respectable Whig (Lord Ducie)
in the county, whom everybody pointed out as the fittest
successor to the late Duke; but he has not three members,
and if he had, he would not shake them <i>in terrorem</i> over
Melbourne&rsquo;s head.</p>

<h3>December 10th and 11th, 1835</h3>

<p>Our Government are in a great
alarm lest this dispute between the French and Americans
should produce a war, and the way in which we should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">AMERICA AND FRANCE.</span>
affected by it is
this:<a name="FNA_30_02" id="FNA_30_02"></a><a href="#FN_30_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;Our
immense manufacturing population
is dependent upon America for a supply of cotton,
and in case of any obstruction to that supply, multitudes
would be thrown out of employment, and incalculable distress
would follow. They think that the French would
blockade the American ports, and then such obstruction
would be inevitable. A system like ours, which resembles
a vast piece of machinery, no part of which can be disordered
without danger to the whole, must be always liable to interruption
or injury from causes over which we have no control;
and this danger must always attend the extension of our
manufacturing system to the prejudice of other interests;
so that in case of a stoppage or serious interruption to the
current in which it flows the consequences would be appalling;
nor is there in all probability a nation on the Continent
(our good ally Louis Philippe included) that would not
gladly contribute to the humiliation of the power and diminution
of the wealth of this country.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_30_02" id="FN_30_02"></a><a href="#FNA_30_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[This dispute arose from the detention of American ships by the
Emperor Napoleon under the Continental system. The Americans claimed
large damages, and the negotiation lasted twenty years. At length General
Jackson, the American President, insisted on payment, and the French
Government settled the matter for twenty-five millions of francs; but the
question led to a change in the French Ministry.]</p></div>

<h3>December 16th, 1835</h3>

<p>Dined with Sefton the day before yesterday
to meet the Hollands; sat between Allen and Luttrell.
Melbourne was there in roaring spirits; met me very cordially,
and after dinner said, &lsquo;Well, how are you? I had a
great deal to say to you, but I forget what it was now.&rsquo; To
which I replied, &lsquo;Oh, never mind now; we are here to
amuse ourselves, and we won&rsquo;t talk of other things.&rsquo; I
could not have <i>settled</i> anything with him there, so there was
no use in beginning; and this put him at his ease, instead of
making him hate the sight of me, and fancying wherever he
met me that I should begin badgering him about my
affairs.<a name="FNA_30_03" id="FNA_30_03"></a><a href="#FN_30_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
In the world men must be dealt with according to what they
are, and not to what they ought to be; and the great art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of life is to find out what they are, and act with them accordingly.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_30_03" id="FN_30_03"></a><a href="#FNA_30_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[This referred to some private affairs of Mr. Greville&rsquo;s which were then
under discussion, and on which Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s influence was important.]</p></div>

<p>Allen talked of Mackintosh, and of his declaration of
religious belief on his deathbed, when he had never believed
at all during his life. He said that Mackintosh was not very
deeply read in theology. Melbourne, on the contrary, is, and
being a very good Greek scholar (which Mackintosh was not),
has compared the Evidences and all modern theological
works with the writings of the Fathers. He did not believe
that Melbourne entertained <i>any doubts</i>, or that his mind was
at all distracted and perplexed with much thinking and
much reading on the subject, but that his studies and reflections
have led him to a perfect <i>conviction</i> of
unbelief.<a name="FNA_30_04" id="FNA_30_04"></a><a href="#FN_30_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
He thought if Mackintosh had lived much with Christians he
would have been one too. We talked of Middleton, and
Allen said that he believed he really died a Christian, but
that he was rapidly ceasing to be one, and if he had lived
would probably have continued the argument of his free
enquiry up to the Apostles themselves. He urged me to
read Lardner; said he had never read Paley nor the more
recent Evidences, the materials of all of which are, however,
taken from Lardner&rsquo;s work. Luttrell was talking of Moore
and Rogers&mdash;the poetry of the former so licentious, that of
the latter so pure; much of its popularity owing to its being
so carefully weeded of everything approaching to indelicacy;
and the contrast between the <i>lives</i> and the <i>works</i> of the two
men&mdash;the former a pattern of conjugal and domestic regularity,
the latter of all the men he had ever known the
greatest sensualist.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_30_04" id="FN_30_04"></a><a href="#FNA_30_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[John Allen was himself so fierce an unbeliever, and so bitter an enemy
to the Christian religion, that he was very fond of asserting that other men
believed as little as himself. It was almost always Allen who gave an irreligious
turn to the conversation at Holland House when these subjects were
discussed there.]</p></div>

<p>Yesterday Lyndhurst and Brougham both came to the
Council Office to hear the first application for the renewal of
a patent, and though there was no opposition, they scrutinised
the petition and evidence with the utmost jealousy,
which they did in order to intimate that the granting a prolongation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FREDERIC ELLIOT.</span>
of the patent, even when unopposed, was not to be
a matter of course. It was a pianoforte invention, and the
instrument was introduced into the Council Chamber, and
played upon by Madame Dülcken for the edification of their
Lordships.</p>

<h3>December 18th, 1835</h3>

<p>Melbourne told me (the other night at
Sefton&rsquo;s) that he had been down to Oatlands to consult F. and
H. about Dr. Arnold (of Rugby), and to ascertain if he could
properly make him a bishop; but they did not encourage
him, which I was surprised at, recollecting the religious
correspondence which formerly passed between them and
him. Arnold, however, shocks the High Churchmen, and is
not considered orthodox; and Melbourne said it would make
a great uproar to put him on the Bench, and was out of the
question. He had been reading his sermons, which he
thought very able.</p>

<h3>December 20th, 1835</h3>

<p>The Treasury have sent a proposed draft
of a minute in my case. When it is over I shall not much
care, for I have long since abandoned all expectation of
being rich, and there are none of my expensive pursuits
which I could not resign very cheerfully. Up to a certain
point riches contribute largely to the happiness of life, but
no farther. To be free from the necessity of daily self-denial
and continual calculation is indispensable to happiness, but
the major luxuries&mdash;ostentatious superfluities&mdash;contribute
little or nothing to rational enjoyment. I have just seen an
excellent letter from Frederic Elliot to Taylor, with a description
of the state of parties and politics in Lower Canada,
which has been shown to the Ministers, who think it the
ablest <i>exposé</i> on those heads that has been transmitted from
thence. I have very little doubt that he will <i>go far</i>; he has
an admirable talent for business, a clear head, liberal and
unprejudiced opinions, and he writes remarkably
well.<a name="FNA_30_05" id="FNA_30_05"></a><a href="#FN_30_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_30_05" id="FN_30_05"></a><a href="#FNA_30_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[This prediction was fulfilled. Mr. Frederic Elliot was the youngest
son of the Rt. Hon. Hugh Elliot, and nephew of the first Earl of Minto.
He went to Canada in 1835 with Lord Gosford, entered the Colonial Office
on his return to England, rose to be Assistant-Under-Secretary in that
department, and is now (1873) Sir T. Frederic Elliot, K.S.M.G.]</p></div>

<h3>December 24th, 1835</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
The Northamptonshire election has
greatly elevated the spirits of the Conservatives, and though
the Whigs affect to hold it cheap, they are not a little disconcerted
by the magnitude of the majority, so unexpected
by both parties. Impartial moderate men (such, for example,
as the judges who sit in my Court) attribute it to a strong
prevailing feeling against O&rsquo;Connell; and it would appear to
be so, because Hanbury, and even Vernon Smith, were compelled
to hold language very adverse to him on the hustings.
This O&rsquo;Connell connection will, after all, probably end in
destroying the Government; his last letter against the Peers
is a very despicable performance, and he will be more injured
by his own than by Burdett&rsquo;s productions.</p>

<h3>December 26th, 1835</h3>

<p>The adherents of Government are
certainly alarmed at the present aspect of things. Lord
William Bentinck, who is as Radical as need be, wrote to
his wife at Paris, &lsquo;Tory matters are certainly looking up
here; that senseless cry against O&rsquo;Connell has produced a
great effect.&rsquo; Nevertheless they affect at Brooks&rsquo;s to hold
it all very cheap.</p>

<h3>December 30th, 1835</h3>

<p>Wednesday at Roehampton&mdash;since
Monday; for the first time since Lord Dover&rsquo;s death.
Luttrell, Poodle Byng, Baring Wall; Lady Dover still in
weeds. Lord Clifden not a jot altered from his usual gaiety;
such is the difference between the feelings of youth and age.</p>

<p>The exultation of the Tories at the Northamptonshire
election has been woefully damped by the result of the
Corporation elections, nine out of ten of which have gone
for the Radicals, and in many places all the persons elected
are of that persuasion. The constituency is certainly different,
and a desire to make <i>maison nette</i> of these dens of
corruption is not unnatural; but it affords a plausible subject
for triumph on the Radical side, and has a formidable
appearance.</p>

<h3>Melton Mowbray, January 20th, 1836</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CHESTERFIELD PAPERS.</span>
I went with Henry de
Ros from London to Middleton last Saturday fortnight, stayed
till the Thursday following, and then to Badminton&mdash;eighteen
years since I had been there. Last Thursday to Bretby;
slept at Worcester on Thursday night, stopped to see the
Cathedrals at Gloucester, Worcester, and Lichfield, and the
Church at Tewkesbury&mdash;all well worth seeing, and containing
curious monuments, especially that of Bishop Hough at
Worcester by Roubiliac, exceedingly grand; and in Lichfield
Cathedral a chapter-house of surpassing beauty. At Bretby
the Duke of Wellington had been, and Peel still was, but
he departed early the next morning. I had been anxious
to go there to look over the Chesterfield MSS., but I was
disappointed; there were only three large volumes of letters
come-at-able out of thirty, the other twenty-seven being
locked up, and the key was gone to be mended. These three
I ran over hastily, but though they may contain matter that
would be useful to the historian of that period (from 1728 to
about 1732), there was little in any way attractive, as they
consisted wholly of diplomatic letters to Lord Chesterfield
during his Embassy at the Hague. As this correspondence
occupied twenty volumes (for the three I found were the
second, third, and twentieth), I fear the others may not contain
anything of greater general interest.</p>

<p>I was desirous of seeing the Duke to hear what he says
to the
Portfolio,<a name="FNA_30_06" id="FNA_30_06"></a><a href="#FN_30_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
which makes so much noise here. Peel
told me that the Duke was not at all annoyed by it, and
that he did not see why Matuscewitz need be either; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Matuscewitz wrote what he thought and believed at the
time, as he was bound to do, and long before his intimacy
with the Duke began. He said that the letters are certainly
authentic, though possibly there may be some omissions.
But the Duke&rsquo;s women endeavour to stir up his resentment,
and to make him think himself ill-used, though he is disposed
to treat the matter with great good-humour and
indifference. Of politics I have heard little, and learnt
nothing; the Tory houses I have successively been at are all
on the alert, and fancy they are to do great things this next
session, but I expect it will all end in smoke.</p>

[A collection of diplomatic papers and correspondence between the
Russian Government and its agents, published about this time by Mr. Urquhart,
which was supposed to throw light on the secret policy of the Cabinet
of St. Petersburg. They were, in fact, copies of the original documents
which had been sent to Warsaw for the information of the Grand Duke
Constantine when Viceroy of Poland, and they fell into the hands of the
insurgents at the time of the Polish Revolution of 1830. Prince Adam
Czartoryski brought them to England, where the publication of them excited
great attention.]</p></div>

<p>The law appointments of
Pepys<a name="FNA_30_07" id="FNA_30_07"></a><a href="#FN_30_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and Bickersteth are
reckoned very good, and they have certainly been made with
especial reference to the fitness of the men to preside over
their respective Courts. Pepys&rsquo;s is perhaps one of the most
curious instances of elevation that ever occurred: a good
sound lawyer, in leading practice at the Bar, never heard of
in politics, no orator, a plain undistinguished man, to whom
expectation never pointed, and upon whom the Solicitor-Generalship
fell as it were by accident, finds himself Master
of the Rolls in a few months after his appointment, by the
sudden death of Leach, and in little more than one year
from that time a peer and Chancellor. I fancy there were
considerable difficulties in settling these appointments, and
in satisfying disappointed expectants, but of the details of
the difficulties I know nothing. They will probably confer
some strength on the Government. We came here yesterday,
and are comfortably lodged at Wilton&rsquo;s.</p>

[Sir Christopher Pepys, Master of the Rolls, was raised to the Peerage
as Lord Cottenham, and received the Great Seal. Mr. Bickersteth
succeeded him as Master of the Rolls, and was raised to the Peerage with
the title of Lord Langdale. These appointments were much discussed, and
at last decided by a vote of the Cabinet, several of the Ministers being in
favour of making Bickersteth Lord Chancellor, because he promised more as
a Law Reformer.]</p></div>

<h3>London, January 30th, 1836</h3>

<p>Dinner yesterday for the
Sheriffs.<a name="FNA_30_08" id="FNA_30_08"></a><a href="#FN_30_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROSPECTS OF THE SESSION.</span>
The plan I had adopted (which was not completely executed,
owing to the absence of some of the judges from the Exchequer
on &lsquo;the morrow of St. Martin&rsquo;s&rsquo;) did very well,
and we had few difficulties with the English counties.
There was Lord Cottenham, for the first time, and Howick
and Poulett Thomson, their first appearances as Cabinet
Ministers. Parliament opens on Thursday, and as far as
I can judge with a favourable prospect for the present
Government. Stanley has openly expressed his opinion that
no changes are desirable, and Peel will not be anxious to
thrust himself in, with a doubtful chance of keeping his
place if he can get it; so the hot and sanguine Tories, who
have been vastly elevated at the prospect they thought was
before them, will have to fret and fume and chew the cud
of disappointment. There was a great Tory gathering at
Drayton the other day, but I have not heard what they resolved
upon. Lord Lansdowne told me yesterday that Stanley
has declared openly the opinion above stated, and he seems
to think they are pretty safe. Tavistock wrote me word that
the Government meant to be moderate, and that any concessions
would be made by, and not to, the violent section.
The great questions likely to be discussed are the Appropriation
clause and the Irish Corporation Bill. The Government
and O&rsquo;Connell are not likely to differ on anything but this,
and if a strong measure passes the House of Commons, the
Lords will throw it out, and probably Government will not
in their hearts be sorry for it. In the balanced state of
parties, the tranquillity and prosperity that prevail, possession
is everything, and I am therefore quite satisfied that nothing
but some unforeseen circumstance or event will disturb these
people. Brougham is seriously ill at Brougham. Melbourne
has been in correspondence with him, and these arrangements
are by way of having been made with his concurrence.
Nothing whatever is settled as to ulterior law matters; the
Vice-Chancellor told me so yesterday, and the Chancellor
told him. They talk of a permanent judge in the Privy
Council, which would be a virtual repeal of the principal
part of Brougham&rsquo;s famous Bill; for if there was one permanent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
judge with a casual <i>quorum</i>, the permanent judge
would in point of fact be the real administrator of the law,
as he used to be under the old system.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_30_08" id="FN_30_08"></a><a href="#FNA_30_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
The Lord President of the Council gives an annual dinner to his colleagues,
at which the list of Sheriffs for the ensuing year is settled. The
arrangements are made by the Clerk of the Council, after the nomination of
the Sheriffs by the Judges.</p></div>

<p>I had a great deal of conversation with Poulett Thomson
last night after dinner on one subject or another; he is very
good-humoured, pleasing, and intelligent, but the greatest
coxcomb I ever saw, and the vainest dog, though his vanity
is not offensive or arrogant; but he told me that when Lord
Grey&rsquo;s Government was formed (at which time he was a
junior partner in a mercantile house, and had been at most
five years in Parliament), he was averse to take office, but
Althorp declared he would not come in unless Thomson
did also, and that, knowing the importance of Althorp&rsquo;s
accession to the Government, he sacrificed a large income,
and took the Board of Trade; that when this was offered to
him, he was asked whether he cared if he was President or
Vice-President, as they wished to make Lord Auckland President
if he (Poulett Thomson) had no objection. He said, provided
the President was not in the Cabinet, he did not care;
and accordingly he condescended to be Vice-President,
knowing that all the business must be done in the House
of Commons, and that he must be (as in fact he said he was)
the virtual head of the office. All this was told with a
good-humoured and smiling complacency, which made me
laugh internally. He then descanted on the inefficiency of
his subordinates; that Auckland did not like writing, that
nobody else could write, and consequently every paper had been
drawn up by himself since he first entered the office. To do
him justice I believe he is very industrious. When he got
into the Cabinet he said he could no longer go on in this
way, and accordingly he has superannuated Lack, and is
going to appoint the best man he can find in his place. This
operation has led to the removal of Hay, whom Stephen
replaces at the Colonial Office.</p>

<h3>February 1st, 1836</h3>

<p>Howick gave me an account yesterday of
Spencer Perceval&rsquo;s communications to the Ministers, and
other Privy Councillors. He called on Howick, who received
him very civilly.  Perceval began, &lsquo;You will probably be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PERCEVAL&rsquo;S APOSTOLIC MISSION.</span>
surprised when you learn, what has brought me here.&rsquo;
Howick bowed. &lsquo;You are aware that God has been pleased
in these latter times to make especial communications of
His will to certain chosen instruments, in a language not
intelligible to those who hear it, nor always to those by
whom it is uttered: I am one of those instruments, to whom
it has pleased the Almighty to make known His will, and
I am come to declare to you, &amp;c...&rsquo; and then he went
off in a rhapsody about the degeneracy of the times, and the
people falling off from God. I asked him what Perceval
seemed to be driving at, what was his definite object? He
said it was not discoverable, but that from the printed paper
which he had circulated to all Privy Councillors (for to that
body he appears to think that his mission is addressed), in
which he specifies all the great acts of legislation for the
last five years (beginning with the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts), as the evidences of a falling off from God,
or as the causes of the divine anger, it may perhaps be
inferred that he means they should all be repealed. It is
a ridiculous and melancholy exposure. His different receptions
by different people are amusing and characteristic.
Howick listened to him with patient civility. Melbourne
argued with and cross-questioned him. He told him &lsquo;that
he ought to have gone to the Bishops rather than to
him,&rsquo; to which Perceval replied, that one of the brethren
(Henry Drummond) was gone to the Archbishop. Stanley
turned him out at once. As soon as he began he said, &lsquo;There
is no use, Mr. Perceval, in going on this way with me. We had,
therefore, better put an end to the subject, and I wish you
good morning.&rsquo; He went to Lord Holland, and Lady Holland
was with great difficulty persuaded to allow him to go and
receive the Apostles. She desired Lord John Russell (who
happened to be in the house) to go with him, but John begged
to be excused, alleging that he had already had his interview
and did not wish for another. So at last she let Lord
Holland be wheeled in, but ordered Edgar and Harold, the
two pages, to post themselves outside the door, and rush
in if they heard Lord Holland scream. Perceval has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
with the King, and went to Drayton after Sir Robert Peel, but
he complains that he cannot catch the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<h3>February 3rd, 1836</h3>

<p>A meeting at the Council Office yesterday
on another patent case, a gun&mdash;Baron Heurteloup, the famous
lithotritic doctor and inventor&mdash;which was clicked off for the
information of their Lordships. Since this Patent Bill, we
have got very noisy between percussion guns and pianofortes.
I walked away with Lyndhurst to hear what he had to say.
He said that he understood Peel was come to town with the
intention of being very active, but that the Duke talked of
staying at Strathfieldsaye till after Easter; and if the Duke
did not attend the House of Lords, no more would he; he said
it was impossible to turn out the Government&mdash;what could
they do? that it would never do for them to come in again
without a considerable majority, and <i>that</i> they had not, nor
would have. What would a dissolution do for them? Not,
I said, anything considerable, if the new Corporations were
to have the influence he always attributed to them, and I
asked him whether the working of the Municipal Bill promised
to be as mischievous as he had expected. He said, &lsquo;Yes, I
think so;&rsquo; but I could see that he does not think so very badly
of it as he once told me. However, I gather from him that
the leaders are aware that the time is not come for attempting
to push out the Government, and that they will not try; their
difficulty will be to deal with their own rash and impatient
followers, who are always for desperate courses. Lyndhurst
told me that he thought Peel felt very bitterly towards
Stanley, and that it must end in their decided opposition to
each other. I confess I never had much faith in any union
between them which was likely to be durable or satisfactory.
Stanley has been living constantly with the Whigs, and
probably looks forward to joining them again, when the
settlement, or some settlement, of the Church question will
allow him; and it will be much more congenial to his tastes
and character to be the rival of Peel than his subordinate.
I told Lyndhurst that I hoped the House of Lords would be
moderate, confine their opposition to certain great measures,
and not thwart the Government without necessity. He said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LYNDHURST ON THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
he was desirous so to do, to deal with great measures of
legislation as they might see fit, but no more. I asked him
why they threw out certain Bills last year, among others the
Dublin Police Bill, to which there really had seemed to be
no objection. He said, for two reasons; one was that they
did not choose to admit the practice that after Parliament had
been sitting many months, during which Bills might have
been sent up, and plenty of time afforded for their consideration,
they should be laid upon the table of the House of Lords
just at the end of the session, when they were to be hurried
over, and passed without that mature deliberation which they
required; and particularly as to the Dublin Police Bill, that
they well knew it was a mere job to provide for certain of
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s friends. He then mentioned a fact in justification
of the first of the above reasons&mdash;that, in discussing with
Duncannon one of the Irish Bills of which he had the
management, he alluded to one particular clause. Duncannon
asserted that there was no such clause in the Bill.
He repeated that there was, when Duncannon went away,
and soon afterwards returned and acknowledged that he had
been in error, that the clause was there, though he was not
aware of it, nor had it been inserted in the copy with which
he had been first furnished.</p>

<p>I heard a great deal more about Perceval&rsquo;s proceedings,
and those of his colleagues yesterday; they continue to visit
the Privy Councillors. Lyndhurst told me he had been with
him for an hour, Lord Lansdowne the same. When he gave
Lord Lansdowne his book, as he glanced over it, Perceval
said, &lsquo;I am aware it is not well written; the composition is not
perfect, but I was not permitted to alter it; I was obliged to
write it as I received it.&rsquo; Drummond went in a chaise and four
to the Archbishop of York at Nuneham, who endeavoured to
stop his mouth with a good luncheon, but this would not do.
He told the Archbishop the end of the world was approaching,
and that it was owing to the neglect of himself and his
brethren that the nation was in its present awful state.
Perceval told Lord Lansdowne that their sect was increasing
greatly and  rapidly; they have several congregations in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
London, two clergymen of the Church of England have
joined them, and two men who still occupy their pulpits are
only waiting for the call which they daily expect to receive.</p>

<h3>February 5th, 1836</h3>

<p>Parliament met yesterday; the King
received with great apathy. The Tories have not begun very
well. After boasting of their increased numbers, and of the
great things they had accomplished by elections during the
recess, they got beaten on a division by 41&mdash;a greater number
than they were ever beaten by last year on any great question.
The speech was a very milk-and-water production, and
scarcely afforded a peg to hang an amendment upon. It is
true that on the point on which the amendment was made
(not pledging the House to adopt the principle of the English
Corporation Act in the Irish Bill) the Duke was probably right,
but a protest would have done just as well, and there was
no need to press an amendment on such a trifle. The other
side felt this in the House of Lords, and gave it up, though
there were so many Ministerial peers in the House that the
division would have been very near; but in the House of
Commons Lord John Russell would not give way, and what is
more, Peel never had any intention of moving any amendment,
for there was a great meeting in the morning at his house, and
there it was resolved that none should be moved; and certainly
very few people expected any. At last he moved it, because
it had been moved in the House of Lords, but it seems to
have been a foolish, bungling business altogether. The
Tories are always hot for dividing, and the silly idle creatures
who compose the bulk of the party apologise for their continual
absence by saying, &lsquo;Oh, you never divide, so what&rsquo;s the
use of coming up,&rsquo; as if divisions must be got up for them
when it suits their convenience to quit their hunting and
shooting and run up to town. Stanley made a strong speech
against the Government, to my great amazement, and,
having been ironically cheered by the Treasury bench, he
got angry. He sat, too, on the Opposition bench (the same
on which Peel sits), nearer the Speaker; still I do not believe
that he will join the Opposition; however, they are surprised
and pleased at the tone he took. Some fancy that the division
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD HOLLAND&rsquo;S ANECDOTES.</span>
and majority last night will be useful to the Government,
and make it out to be very important, which, however,
I think is making much more of it than it deserves. The
debate was very bad; everybody spoke wretchedly.</p>

<h3>February 6th, 1836</h3>

<p>I only heard last night what passed at
Peel&rsquo;s meeting; for he desired it might not be repeated, and
that the meeting should be considered confidential; he made
them a speech, in which he indicated in pretty plain terms,
but without mentioning names, that it was of great consequence
to shape their proceedings so as to get the support of
Stanley, and that they never would be sure what line he
would take; so that he does look to Stanley, notwithstanding
what Lyndhurst says of his real sentiments concerning
him, which, no doubt, is correct.</p>

<h3>February 7th, 1836</h3>

<p>Last night I went to Holland House;
found my Lord and my Lady sitting <i>tête-à-tête</i>. About twelve
she went to bed, and Standish and I stayed with him till
two o&rsquo;clock, hearing his accounts of speeches and speakers
of old times, and anecdotes, some of which I had heard
before, and some not, but they bear repeating. He is marvellously
entertaining in this way; the stories so good, so
well told, his imitations of the actors in the events which he
narrates giving you such a conviction of their fidelity. If
Lord Holland has prepared any memoirs, and put down all he
remembers, as well as all he has been personally concerned
in, it will make a delightful book. I asked him if his uncle
and Pitt were in habits of communication in the House of
Commons, and on terms of mutual civility and good-humour,
and he said, &lsquo;Oh yes, very; I think they had a great respect
for each other; latterly I think my uncle was more bitter
against him&rsquo;&mdash;I enquired whether he thought they would
have joined? He thought they might have done so. He
thinks the finest speeches Fox made (if it were possible to
select out of so many fine ones) were on the war, on the
Scrutiny, and on Bonaparte&rsquo;s overtures. Grattan complimenting
him on his speech on the war, he said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know if it was good, but I know I can&rsquo;t make a better.&rsquo;
Fox never wrote his speeches, was fond of preparing them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
travelling, as he said a postchaise was the best place to arrange
his thoughts in. Sheridan wrote and prepared a great deal,
and generally in bed, with his books, pen, and ink, on the
bed, where he would lie all day. Brougham wrote and rewrote,
over and over again, whole speeches; he has been
known to work fifteen hours a day for six weeks together.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable the effect the division on the address
has had. Holland said last night he thought it had given
them a new lease, and Hobhouse, whom I met in the morning
in high glee, talked with great contempt of the tactics
and miserable composition of the Tory party. He said that
he knew to a vote what their numbers would be on the
Church question, and <i>on everything else</i> they should beat
them hollow (he did not mean, of course, to include the Irish
Corporation Bill in this). The sensible Tories admit it to
have been a great blunder, but the authors of the folly affect
to bluster and put a good face on it, though it is easy to see
that they are really in doleful dumps. But of all bad hits
Stanley certainly made the worst. He went on to the last
moment living with the Ministers with the utmost cordiality,
and giving them to understand that he was generally friendly
to them; talked strong anti-Tory language, and impressed
on them the conviction that he was with them on everything
but the Church. (Exactly like his conduct to Peel and his
former colleagues on the matter of Free Trade when he
separated from them&mdash;1847.) If he had contented himself
with declaring that he did not mean to be committed to
any particular course by the address, and deprecated a division,
he would not only have prevented it, but he would have
at once placed himself in a respectable position as a sort of
mediator and arbiter between the two parties, and would have
had the satisfaction of showing the world that both were
disposed to treat him with deference and respect. A word
from Stanley would have made Peel abstain from moving
his amendment or withdraw it. I met Graham the day before
yesterday in the Park, but only exchanged a few words with
him. He said the division was a very bad business.</p>

<h3>February 9th, 1836</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MACAULAY AND BROUGHAM.</span>
I was talking yesterday with Stephen
about Brougham and Macaulay. He said he had known
Brougham above thirty years, and well remembers walking
with him down to Clapham, to dine with old Zachary
Macaulay, and telling him he would find a prodigy of a
boy there of whom he must take notice. This was Tom
Macaulay. Brougham afterwards put himself forward as
the monitor and director of the education of Macaulay,
and I remember hearing of a letter he wrote to the father
on the subject, which made a great noise at the time; but
he was like the man who brought up a young lion, which
finished by biting his head off. Brougham and Macaulay
disliked each other. Brougham could not forgive his great
superiority in many of those accomplishments in which he
thought himself unrivalled; and being at no pains to disguise
his jealousy and dislike, the other was not behind him in
corresponding feelings of aversion. It was unworthy of both,
but most of Brougham, who was the aggressor, and who
might have considered the world large enough for both of
them, and that a sufficiency of fame was attainable by each.
Stephen said that, if ever Macaulay&rsquo;s life was written by a
competent biographer, it would appear that he had displayed
feats of memory which he believed to be unequalled by any
human being. He can repeat all Demosthenes by heart,
and all Milton, a great part of the Bible, both in English
and (the New Testament) in Greek; besides this his memory
retains passages innumerable of every description of books,
which in discussion he pours forth with incredible facility.
He is passionately fond of Greek literature; has not much
taste for Latin or French. Old Mill (one of the best Greek
scholars of the day) thinks Macaulay has a more extensive
and accurate acquaintance with the Greek writers than any
man living, and there is no Greek book of any note which
he has not read over and over again. In the Bible he takes
great delight, and there are few better Biblical scholars.
In law he made no proficiency, and mathematics he abominates;
but his great forte is history, especially English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
history. Here his superhuman memory, which appears to
have the faculty of digesting and arranging as well as of
retaining, has converted his mind into a mighty magazine
of knowledge, from which, with the precision and correctness
of a kind of intellectual machine, he pours forth stores of
learning, information, precept, example, anecdote, and illustration
with a familiarity and facility not less astonishing
than delightful. He writes as if he had lived in the times
and among the people whose actions and characters he
records and delineates. A little reading, too, is enough for
Macaulay, for by some process impossible to other men he
contrives to transfer as it were, by an impression rapid and
indelible, the contents of the books he reads to his own
mind, where they are deposited, always accessible, and never
either forgotten or confused. Far superior to Brougham in
general knowledge, in fancy, imagination, and in the art of
composition, he is greatly inferior to him in those qualities
which raise men to social and political eminence. Brougham,
tall, thin, and commanding in figure, with a face which,
however ugly, is full of expression, and a voice of great
power, variety, and even melody, notwithstanding his occasional
prolixity and tediousness, is an orator in every sense
of the word. Macaulay, short, fat, and ungraceful, with a
round, thick, unmeaning face, and with rather a lisp, though
he has made speeches of great merit, and of a very high
style of eloquence in point of composition, has no pretensions
to be put in competition with Brougham in the House of
Commons. Nor is the difference and the inferiority of
Macaulay less marked in society. Macaulay, indeed, is a
great talker, and pours forth floods of knowledge on all
subjects; but the gracefulness, lightness, and variety are
wanting in his talk which are so conspicuous in his writings;
there is not enough of alloy in the metal of his conversation;
it is too didactic, it is all too good, and not sufficiently
flexible, plastic, and diversified for general society. Brougham,
on the other hand, is all life, spirit, and gaiety&mdash;&lsquo;from grave
to gay, from lively to severe&rsquo;&mdash;dashing through every description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD WILLIAM BENTINCK.</span>
of folly and fun, dealing in those rapid transitions
by which the attention and imagination are arrested and
excited; always amusing, always instructive, never tedious,
elevated to the height of the greatest intellect, and familiar
with the most abstruse subjects, and at the same moment
conciliating the humble pretensions of inferior minds by
dropping into the midst of their pursuits and objects with
a fervour and intensity of interest which surprises and delights
his associates, and, above all, which puts them at
their ease.</p>

<p>[<i>Quantum mutatus!</i> All this has long ceased to be true
of Brougham. Macaulay, without having either the wit or
the <i>charm</i> which constitutes the highest kind of colloquial
excellence or success, is a marvellous, an unrivalled (in his
way), and a delightful talker.&mdash;1850.]</p>

<h3>February 12th, 1836</h3>

<p>Lord William Bentinck has published
an address to the electors of Glasgow which is remarkable,
because he is the first man of high rank and station who has
publicly professed the ultra-Radical opinions which he avows
in this document. It is by no means well done, and a very
silly address in many respects. He is a man whose success
in life has been greater than his talents warrant, for he is
not right-headed, and has committed some great blunder or
other in every public situation in which he has been placed;
but he is simple in his habits, popular in his manners,
liberal in his opinions, and magnificently hospitable in his
mode of life. These qualities are enough to ensure popularity.
Here is the inscription for the column, or whatever
it be, that they have erected to his honour in India, written
by Macaulay:&mdash;</p>

<h3>February 20th, 1836</h3>

<p>I walked home with Lord Sandon last
night, and had much talk about the state of parties, particularly
about Peel and the events at the close of the
last session. He talked upon the usual topic of Peel&rsquo;s
coldness, uncommunicative disposition, want of popular
qualities, and the consequent indifference of his followers to
his person. With respect to last year, he said that Peel had
arranged with the Duke of Wellington and Lyndhurst the
course that it would be advisable to adopt with regard to
the Corporation Bill, and that he was put exceedingly out
of humour by the House of Lords adopting a different line;
that the leaders of the Lords found their party impracticable,
and they were compelled (or thought themselves so) to give
way to the prejudices of the majority. But Peel did not
understand this <i>knocking under</i> to violence and folly, and his
pride was mortified, because it was a sort of renunciation of
his authority as leader and chief of the whole party. Accordingly
it was with reference to these proceedings that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD SANDON&rsquo;S OPINION OF PEEL.</span>
Peel spoke with great bitterness to Sandon, and said that
&lsquo;he never would be the tool of the Lords,&rsquo; He left town in
high dudgeon, and was probably not sorry to display his
resentment at the same time with his power, when he suddenly
returned and made his speech on the Lords&rsquo; amendments.
Sandon confirmed the statement of his having done
this without any communication with the Duke and Lyndhurst,
in which he thinks he was to blame. I think he
ought to have seen the Duke, and have imparted to him his
intentions and his motives; but with Lyndhurst he probably
felt very angry for the part he took. He has now, however,
put himself more openly and decidedly at the head of the
party, and Sandon considers that Stanley already virtually
belongs to it, inasmuch as they sit together and consult
together, and the other day when he went to Peel&rsquo;s house he
found Stanley there.</p>

<h3>February 21st, 1836</h3>

<p>There is a mighty stir about the appointment
of Dr. Hampden to the Regius Professorship of
Divinity at Oxford, on the ground of his having put forth
doctrines or arguments of a Socinian tendency. The two
Archbishops went to Melbourne with a remonstrance, but he
told them the appointment was completed, and that he had
not been aware of any objections to Dr. Hampden, and had
taken pains to ascertain his fitness for the office. It will
give the Churchmen a handle for accusing Melbourne of a
design to sap the foundations of the Church and poison
the fountain of orthodoxy; but he certainly has no such
view.</p>

<h3>February 23rd, 1836</h3>

<p>Had some conversation with Lord
Wharncliffe the other day, who has always been a great
alarmist. I asked him if he was so still. He said yes; that
he was convinced the House of Lords and the House of Commons
could not go on, that the Lords would not pass their
Bills; a ferment would be produced, which would finish by an
open dissension. &lsquo;What, then, would be the result?&rsquo; I asked.
&lsquo;Why, the Lords would be beaten.&rsquo; He then complained bitterly
of the Government, and of their conduct and language,
and said he was convinced Lord John Russell had originally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
introduced that clause for the purpose of effecting a permanent
quarrel between the two Houses. I told him I was satisfied
there was no danger if their party would act a prudent,
temperate, and honourable part; if they would not aim at
office, but be satisfied to exert the strength they possessed
not for party, but for Conservative purposes; and on this I
dilated, showing what they ought to do. He said that the
Tories never would be contented so to act. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;I certainly won&rsquo;t pretend to answer for the consequences,
but I am sure you have a good game enough in your hands,
if you choose to play it; if you will throw it away, that is
another thing.&rsquo; He told me one thing of Melbourne rather
droll. Wharncliffe gave notice of a motion (which comes on
to-night) about Lord John Russell&rsquo;s appointment of magistrates
under the new Act, which he declares to have been very
partially and improperly done. After speaking to Melbourne
about it, Melbourne came over to him (Wharncliffe) and
said, &lsquo;Now tell me, have we been very bad in our appointments?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Last night I sat next to Poulett Thomson at dinner,
who told me a great deal about Dr. Hampden&rsquo;s
appointment,<a name="FNA_30_09" id="FNA_30_09"></a><a href="#FN_30_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
which makes such an uproar among the Tories and High
Churchmen. He declares that Melbourne consulted various
authorities, and the Archbishop of Canterbury among the
rest, who made no objection to the appointment; that when
the Oxford remonstrance was sent up the Archbishop wrote
a very Jesuitical letter, in which he endeavoured to reconcile
his former approbation of the appointment with his present
concurrence in the remonstrance. Melbourne sent for him,
and asked whether he had any charge to make against
Hampden; he replied that he had none; when Melbourne
said that he could not, then, cancel the appointment,
which had been already notified to him. [This account of
Poulett Thomson&rsquo;s was, however, untrue. William Cowper,
Melbourne&rsquo;s private secretary and nephew, gave me another,
which I doubt not is more correct, and puts the matter in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DR. HAMPDEN&rsquo;S APPOINTMENT.</span>
very different point of view. Melbourne sent to the Archbishop
and desired him to give him a list of six names,
which he accordingly did; but Melbourne would not take
any of them, and without consulting the Archbishop about
Hampden, appointed him. He did consult Coplestone and
some others, but not the Archbishop. I believe the cry
against Hampden to be a senseless cry, and that it is raised
by mere bigotry and spite, but I think Melbourne behaved
neither prudently nor properly. When he desired the
Archbishop to give him a list of six, the latter must certainly
have conceived that he would select one out of the number,
and would not have divined that he would pass them all over
and appoint another man without consulting him at all.&mdash;<i>February
28th</i>.] I have read the pamphlet written against
Hampden, and though some of his expressions are perhaps
imprudent as giving occasion to malicious cavil, it contains
no grave matter, and nothing to support an accusation of
heterodoxy. If he had been a Tory instead of a Liberal in
politics, we should probably have heard nothing of the matter.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_30_09" id="FN_30_09"></a><a href="#FNA_30_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[This was the appointment of Dr. Hampden to be Regius Professor of
Divinity at Oxford. He was raised to the See of Hereford in 1848.]</p></div>

<p>I was surprised to hear Poulett Thomson talk in great
indignation of Lord William Bentinck&rsquo;s address to Glasgow,
which he characterised as very disgraceful, and asserted
that such miserable truckling to the will of his constituents
would not avail him anything, but rather diminish their
respect for him&mdash;very good sentiments. The Government
are very angry at what took place about the Orange Lodge
resolutions. Mr. Jervis moves an address to the Crown
to-night, and Perceval proposed to Lord John Russell to
draw up some resolution condemning these associations,
which he said they would agree to if not violent and offensive,
and that it was very desirable the sentiments of the
House of Commons should be expressed unanimously, or by
a very large majority, because in that case the Orangemen
would see the necessity of yielding obedience to them, and
would do so. Accordingly John Russell sent him the copy of
a resolution (on Saturday) which he proposed to bring forward,
but which he said he had not yet submitted to the
Cabinet. This was communicated to Peel and Stanley as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
well, and all parties agreed to it; but John Russell was much
surprised and disgusted when this resolution (which was
communicated quite privately to Perceval, and which he
told him his colleagues had not been as yet consulted about)
appeared yesterday morning in the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>February 25th, 1836</h3>

<p>Lord John Russell immortalised himself
on Tuesday night. After a speech from Hume of three hours,
in which he produced a variety of the most inconceivable
letters from Kenyon, Wynford, Londonderry, and other
Orangemen, but made the most miserable hash of his
whole case, and instead of working up his ample materials
with dexterity and effect stupidly blundering and wasting
them all&mdash;after this speech John Russell rose, and in a
speech far surpassing his usual form, dignified, temperate,
and judicious, moved a resolution of a moderate and inoffensive
character. The speech actually drew tears from the
Orangemen, enthusiastic approbation from Stanley, a colder
approval from Peel, and the universal assent of the House.
It was a night of harmony; the Orangemen behaved very
well, and declared that after this speech they would
abandon their association; they only objected to the Orange
Lodges being mentioned by name, and urged that the resolution
should be only general in expression; and in this Stanley
and Peel supported them; Lord John declined, and properly;
the others would have done better to advise the Orangemen not
to cavil at this, but to swallow the whole pill handsomely,
and not mar the effect of their really meritorious conduct by
making any trivial difficulties. Peel&rsquo;s and Stanley&rsquo;s speeches
were characteristic; the latter with a generous enthusiasm of
praise and congratulation to his old friend, which evinced
feeling and was sincere; Peel colder in his expressions, and
showing a great interest in the Orangemen, for the purpose
evidently of conciliating them towards himself, and even incurring
some risk of disturbing the general harmony by his
warmth and sympathy towards them; but I have no doubt
that he is as glad as any man at the dissolution of the confederacy,
which now appears likely really to take place, for
though they will probably not actually dissolve themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD RUSSELL AND THE ORANGEMEN.</span>
when the chiefs abandon the lodges their existence will be
but a lingering one, and must come to an end or cease to be
dangerous. In accomplishing this by moderate and healing
counsels, by a conciliatory tone and manner, Lord John Russell
deserves the name of a statesman. His speech is worth
a thousand flowery harangues which have elicited the shouts
of audiences or the admiration of readers, and he has probably
conferred a great and permanent benefit upon the
country. I do not mean that peace will be by these means
restored to Ireland, or rather be bestowed on her, for when
was she ever at peace? but until this object was accomplished,
till the way was cleared, peace was unattainable. O&rsquo;Connell
behaved wisely; he made a short speech, and fell in cordially
with the general feeling of the House. This has strengthened
the Government in reality, as it ought. So Lord Stanley
said, and it is true.</p>

<h3>March 8th, 1836</h3>

<p>It is impossible to conceive anything like
the stagnation in the political world&mdash;the Government secure
in their seats, the Opposition aware of the helplessness of
their efforts. I met
Moore<a name="FNA_31_01" id="FNA_31_01"></a><a href="#FN_31_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
at dinner a day or two ago, not
having seen him for a long time. He told us some amusing
anecdotes of his own reception in Ireland, which was very
enthusiastic, in spite of his having quarrelled with O&rsquo;Connell.
Of this quarrel he likewise narrated the beginning and the
end. He was indignant at O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s <i>manner</i> of prosecuting
his political objects, and resolved to put his feelings on record.
This he did, and he afterwards wrote some letters to a
mutual friend explanatory of his sentiments and motives,
and these were shown (intentionally) to O&rsquo;Connell. Moore declined
to retract or qualify, and a rupture consequently took
place. When they met at Brookes&rsquo; O&rsquo;Connell averted his
face. So things remained till a short time ago, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">OPPOSITION DEFEATED.</span>
editor of a new quarterly review, which has been established
for Catholic and Irish objects, wrote to Moore for his support,
and O&rsquo;Connell, whom he told of it, said, &lsquo;Oh, pray let
me frank the letter to Mr. Moore.&rsquo; This was repeated, and
when Moore met O&rsquo;Connell the other day at Brookes&rsquo;, he
went up to him and put out his hand. He said O&rsquo;Connell
was mightily moved, but accepted the proffered reconciliation,
and they are again on good terms.</p>

<h3>March 10th, 1836</h3>

<p>Majority of 64 for Government on Tuesday
night; unexpected by the public, but not, I take it, by the
Whig managers, who make their people attend. It is an
irrecoverable blow to the other side, and shows that the
contest is hopeless there. O&rsquo;Connell and Stanley made
good speeches. It is remarkable that the Tory numbers are
precisely what they were last year (243). At the levee
yesterday they were all very gay at this victory; and Hobhouse
said to me, &lsquo;What fools they are; they don&rsquo;t know
their own interest; they are beaten in the House of Commons,
their people won&rsquo;t attend, they won&rsquo;t see that they can&rsquo;t resist
these questions and that it is for their own interest they
should be carried; why, when the appropriation clauses
and these Bills are carried there will remain no difference
between Peel and us. As for me, I care not who is in, or
whether I am in or out of office; I care for peace and quietness,
and that the country should go on. The Tories have
rung the changes on this O&rsquo;Connell cry till they can do no
more, and it has failed them entirely; they have had every
chance, and must now give it up;&rsquo; and a good deal more he
said, till we were interrupted. I agree about the O&rsquo;Connell
cry; the subject is worn threadbare, it has been argued and
ranted upon <i>usque ad nauseam</i>, and in spite of the mistakes
O&rsquo;Connell has made, the anti-Popery prejudices which prevail,
and the blots upon his personal character, I doubt if he
is as much hated in England as the Tories would have him.
They have overdone their attacks on him, and as it has
unluckily been their sole <i>cheval de bataille</i>, they have ridden
it till it has not a leg to stand upon.</p>

<h3>March 12th, 1836</h3>

<p>Fell in with Lyndhurst in the street yesterday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
returning from Philips&rsquo;, where he had been sitting for
his portrait. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, in his laughing, off-hand way,
&lsquo;we are done, entirely done.&rsquo; &lsquo;What do you mean to do?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Oh, we shall pass Peel&rsquo;s Bill, and they will be very glad of it;
it will give the Government all the power which O&rsquo;Connell
would otherwise obtain, and they don&rsquo;t want to see his power
increase, and will prefer the augmentation of their own.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>March 13th, 1836</h3>

<p>It was only yesterday that I read the report
of the Committee and O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s complete
acquittal.<a name="FNA_31_02" id="FNA_31_02"></a><a href="#FN_31_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It is
very singular that he does not seem to have known his own
case, or he might have rebutted the accusations in the first
instance; but it has turned out lucky for him, as it has
afforded him a great triumph and his adversaries an equally
great mortification. It is now time for the Tories to give up
attacking him&mdash;that is, making him their grand political butt.
They do not lower him; on the contrary, they raise his importance
everywhere, and make his sway in Ireland more
absolute. They are abominably sulky at this result of the
Committee, which, however, was fairly constituted and
unanimous in its decision. I must say I never expected
they would make out much of a case. Yesterday I dined
with Ben Stanley in Downing Street, and met Lytton Bulwer
and Fonblanque, the latter a very agreeable man.</p>

[The proceedings of the Committee on the Carlow election are here
referred to. A Mr. Raphael had been returned for Carlow, chiefly by the
influence of O&rsquo;Connell. He was unseated on petition, and it was supposed
that the evidence taken by the Committee would incriminate O&rsquo;Connell,
but the reverse was the case. O&rsquo;Connell was wholly acquitted of any illegal
or improper practices.]</p></div>

<h3>May 2nd, 1836</h3>

<p>Many weeks without a single line. I have been
at Newmarket, and have known nothing of any sort or kind.
All seems quieter in the political world than for a long time
past. There was a meeting of Peers at Apsley House a week
or ten days ago, to consider the course they should adopt
about the Corporation Bill. After the discussion Alvanley rose
and asked the Duke if there would be any more meetings.
He said he was not aware that there would be, when Alvanley
said that he was of opinion that the majority of the House
of Lords, while dealing with the Government measures, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD ALVANLEY&rsquo;S PLAN FOR IRELAND.</span>
bound to give notice to the country of the measures of relief
that they were themselves prepared to offer to Ireland, that
in his opinion the only real relief that could be given was
some system of poor law, and the payment of the Catholic
clergy, bringing that body under the control of the Government,
and making it penal to draw contributions from their
flocks, and that he trusted their Lordships would be prepared
to go so far. He describes the effect of this suggestion to
have been most ludicrous. The Duke of Newcastle, who sat
by him, was ready to bounce off his chair; all sorts of indistinct
noises, hems, grunts, and coughs of every variety of
modulation and expressive intonation were heard, but no
answer and no remark. He told me that he had intended
on Tuesday last to repeat the same thing in the House of
Lords, and asked me to go down and hear him, but they would
not allow him. The Duke said it was out of the question, and
overruled him. I am very sorry he did not, for these are the true
remedies, and I wish to see them put forth, and a beginning
made of bringing such principles into action; but the Duke
is not the man to let others have the credit of such measures.
I expect to see the day when he will bring them forward
himself; it is a pig not yet fit for killing, and he will not let
anybody stick it but himself.</p>

<h3>May 11th, 1836</h3>

<p>Great talk about the adjournment of Parliament
on the 20th, and about Melbourne&rsquo;s affair with Mrs.
Norton, which latter, if it is not quashed, will be inconvenient.
John Bull fancies himself vastly moral, and the Court
is mighty prudish, and between them our off-hand Premier
will find himself in a ticklish position. He has been served
with notices, but people rather doubt the action coming on.
I asked the Duke of Wellington a night or two ago what he
had heard of it, and what he thought would be the result. He
said he had only heard what everybody said, and that nothing
would result. I said, &lsquo;Would Melbourne resign?&rsquo; &lsquo;O Lord,
no! Resign? Not a bit of it. I tell you all these things
are a nine-days&rsquo; wonder; it can&rsquo;t come into court before
Parliament is up. People will have done talking of it before
that happens; it will all blow over, and won&rsquo;t signify a straw.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
So spoke his Grace. I doubt not prime ministers, ex and
in, have a fellow-feeling and sympathy for each other, and
like to lay down the principle of such things <i>not mattering</i>.
I hope, however, that it <i>will</i> blow over, for it would really be
very inconvenient and very mischievous. The Tories would
fall on the individual from political violence, the Radicals on
his class or order from hatred to the aristocracy. I believe
the adjournment is principally on account of the affairs of
Canada, regarding which the Government is in a difficulty
that appears inextricable. I have heard a great deal on the
subject, enough to show the magnitude of the embarrassment,
but not enough to describe the state of things.</p>

<h3>May 25th, 1836</h3>

<p>The Epsom races being over, which always
absorb every other interest, I have leisure to turn my mind
to other things. This year there has been a miserable
catastrophe. Berkeley Craven deliberately shot himself after
losing more than he could pay. It is the first instance of a
man of rank and station in society making such an exit. He
had originally a large landed estate, strictly entailed, got
into difficulties, was obliged to go abroad, compromised with
his creditors and returned, fell into fresh difficulties, involved
himself inextricably in betting, and went on with a determination
to shoot himself if his speculations failed, and so
he did. He was very popular, had been extremely handsome
in his youth, and was a fellow of infinite pleasantry and
good-humour.</p>

<p>Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s affair after all is likely to come before
a court of law. He is very much annoyed at it, and so are
his relations, but nobody expects him to resign. The Low
Tories, the herd, exult at this misfortune, and find a motive
for petty political gratification in it, but not so the Duke of
Wellington or any of them who are above the miserable
feelings of party spite. I am sorry for it, because it is a
bad thing to see men in high places dragged through the
mire.</p>

<p>I have heard a curious fact connected with the dismissal
of Mendizabal from his post of Prime Minister. He made
an attempt on the person of the Queen, which she resented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RESULT OF LORD MELBOURNE&rsquo;S TRIAL.</span>
with the greatest aversion and rage. He afterwards wrote
an apology, and then, aware of the blunder of so committing
himself, endeavoured to get his letter back, which she refused
to part with. The consequence was that she availed herself
of the first opportunity to get rid of him.</p>

<h3>June 9th, 1836</h3>

<p>Dined at St. James&rsquo;s yesterday with the
Jockey Club. The King made a speech about himself and the
Queen and the turf; he told us &lsquo;the Queen was an excellent
woman, as we all knew, and that of all the societies which
he had to entertain (which in his capacity were many and
various) we were the most truly British.&rsquo; He was very tired,
and withdrew early. Wharncliffe said he was weary and
dejected.</p>

<h3>June 27th, 1836</h3>

<p>The town has been full of Melbourne&rsquo;s
trial;<a name="FNA_31_03" id="FNA_31_03"></a><a href="#FN_31_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
great exultation at the result on the part of his political
adherents, great disappointment on that of the mob of Low
Tories, and a creditable satisfaction among the better sort;
it was in point of fact a very triumphant acquittal. The
wonder is how with such a case Norton&rsquo;s family ventured into
court, but (although it is stoutly denied) there can be no doubt
that old Wynford was at the bottom of it all, and persuaded
Lord Grantley to urge it on for mere political purposes.
There is pretty conclusive evidence of this. Fletcher Norton,
who was examined on the trial, is staying in town with a
Mr. Lowe, a Nottinghamshire parson, and Denison, who is
Norton&rsquo;s neighbour, called on him the other day; Denison
talked to Lowe, who told him that Fletcher Norton had
shown him the case on which they were going to proceed,
and that he had told him he thought it was a very weak
one, to which he had replied so did he, but he believed they
expected it would produce a very important <i>political</i> effect.
The King behaved very civilly about it, and expressed his
satisfaction at the result in terms sufficiently flattering to
Melbourne.</p>

<p>To-night is the great night in the House of Lords, when
they are to deal with the Commons&rsquo; amendments of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Municipal Bill. Lord Grey is expected to speak, and he
told his old colleagues that if he did he should say what they
would not like. The fact is, he is out of humour. First
he doesn&rsquo;t like being laid aside, though he would not own this
even to himself, and as he and Howick disagree on many
points, Howick tells him nothing, and consequently he knows
nothing, and this provokes him; then he is indignant at the
O&rsquo;Connellism of the Government, and abhors the attacks on
<i>his order</i>. Tavistock talked to me a great deal yesterday
about Lord John Russell, who he declares is by no means
the Radical he is accused by his adversaries of being, that
he is opposed tooth and nail to the reform of the House of
Lords, much disagreeing with O&rsquo;Connell, that he has constantly
and firmly refused to comply with the demands of the
Dissenters in the matter of Church rates, and that in the
Ecclesiastical Commission he and the bishops are on the best
terms, and they are abundantly satisfied with him, that the
greatest Reformer there is Lord Harrowby, and John Russell
has had to act as mediator between him and the bishops.
The prelates, it seems, have grasped at patronage with all
their might, and have taken to themselves that which appertained
to the chapters, much to the disgust of the latter;
they likewise endeavoured to get hold of that which belongs
to the Chancellor, and on this occasion John wrote on a
slip of paper (which he threw across the table to the Archbishop
of York), &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t object to your robbing one another,
but I can&rsquo;t let you rob the Crown.&rsquo; The Archbishop wrote
back, &lsquo;That is just what I expected from you.&rsquo; This shows
at least the good-humour that prevails among them.</p>

<p>There has been such a stagnation in politics lately that
I have heard nothing, and having been laid up with the gout
for a fortnight, have seen scarcely anybody. The greatest
interest I have had has been in the dramatic representation
at Bridgewater House, to the rehearsals of which I ventured
to go. They were very brilliant and successful. As the
space was limited, the invitations necessarily were so, and
everybody was wild to be there. There were one or two
<i>tracasseries</i> growing out of the thing, agitating for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THEATRICALS AT BRIDGEWATER HOUSE.</span>
moment, but very uninteresting in themselves. The pieces
were &lsquo;Glenfinlas,&rsquo; taken from Walter Scott&rsquo;s ballad, and
&lsquo;Lalla Rookh,&rsquo; from Moore&rsquo;s poem; the principal performers
were James Wortley, my brother Henry, Mitford, Mrs. Bradshaw,
Miss Kemble (Mrs. Sartoris); and the chorus was composed
of Mrs. Baring, Mrs. Hartopp, Miss Gent, Miss Paget,
Lady Mary Paget (Lady Sandwich), Lady Wallscourt, Lady
Georgiana Mitford, my sister, Lord Compton, Messrs. Westmacott,
Holford, James Macdonald, Baynton Lushington.
Grieve painted beautiful scenery, and the dresses were
magnificent; all the ladies were covered with diamonds,
which the great jewellers lent to them for the occasion.
Mrs. Bradshaw&rsquo;s acting was perfection itself, and altogether
it was singular, striking, and eminently successful, especially
&lsquo;Glenfinlas,&rsquo; which was very ingeniously managed, and went
off to the amazement of those who were concerned in it,
who did not expect such success.</p>

<h3>July 1st, 1836</h3>

<p>At Stoke for three days; divine weather,
profusion of flowers and shade, and every luxury; nobody
there of any consequence. On Tuesday night at the House
of Lords to hear the debate, which was worth hearing.
Lyndhurst spoke very ably, by far the finest style of speaking,
so measured, grave, and earnest, nothing glittering
and gaudy, but a manly and severe style of eloquence. Lord
Grey spoke very becomingly, but was feeble compared
with what he used to be. He endeavoured to effect a
compromise, and said nothing offensive to anybody or any
party, spoke strongly in favour of the Ministerial measure,
and I think took the sound view. I have no doubt the
Tory Lords are all in the wrong in taking the course they
do, and their arguments are very frivolous and inefficient.
O&rsquo;Connell was not in the House during Lyndhurst&rsquo;s philippic,
but came in soon after, and his arrival made a great
bustle.</p>

<h3>July 9th, 1836</h3>

<p>Since Monday (4th) at De Ros&rsquo;s villa. The
division on the appropriation clause and the majority of only
twenty-six was hailed with great triumph by the Tories, and
was a grievous disappointment to the Government. This,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
with the Warwickshire election at the same moment, has
made them very down in the mouth, and raised the <i>Conservative
stock</i> pretty considerably. There was very sharp work
between Stanley and John Russell, who left off <i>noble friending</i>
and took to <i>noble lording</i> him, to show that they were quite
two. The fact is that they are in a huge difficulty with this
appropriation clause, which served their turn for a while
(when it turned out Peel and cemented their alliance with
the Radicals), and now it hangs like a millstone round their
necks, and is not unlikely to produce the dissolution of the
Government. Strange that this Irish Church in one way or
another is the insuperable obstacle to peace and tranquillity
in Ireland, and to the stability of any Administration here;
and yet it is fought for as if the prosperity or salvation of
the State depended on it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tantum <i>religio</i> potuit suadere malorum.</span>
</div></div>

<p>As far as the Whig Ministers are concerned it serves them
right, for it was a wicked and foolish proceeding; their
conduct will tell against them in the country, and when the
House of Lords is accused of stopping legislation, people
will not fail to ask, What else is the House of Commons
doing, or rather how much more? They assert that tithes
are the great bane of Ireland, and the cause of the disorder
which prevail, and they propose a Tithe Bill as the remedy,
but they clog it with a condition which they know, with as
much certainty as human knowledge can attain, will prevent
its passing into a law, and in this shape they persist in
producing it. Lord John Russell and his colleagues, it is
said, are pledged not to pass a Tithe Bill without this
clause; but what cares the public for their pledges, and
what is their consistency compared with the great interests
at stake, and which are involved in the settlement of this
question?</p>

<p>They acted &lsquo;Genfinlas&rsquo; for the last time on Thursday, with
greater success than ever. The Queen was invited, but did
not come. All London is intent upon morning amusements&mdash;morning
parties, which are extended into the night. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">APPROPRIATION CLAUSE ABANDONED.</span>
Duchess of Buccleuch gave entertainments on Monday and
Wednesday; De Ros on Friday&mdash;dinners, tents, illuminations,
and dancing; all very gay for those who can find
amusement in it, which I have ceased to do.</p>

<h3>July 18th, 1836</h3>

<p>On Thursday night, almost as soon as I got
back from Newmarket, I heard that it was strongly suspected
that the Cabinet were in great embarrassment about the Irish
Church question, and of course the Tories were proportionably
elated at the visions of return to office which are always
ready to dance before their eyes. This report was confirmed
to me the next day (Friday) by Lord Tavistock, who told me
what really was the case. The late division seems to have
made a considerable impression, and several of the supporters
of Government have represented that matters cannot continue
in their present state, and that the resistance to payment
of tithe on the one hand and the threats of rebellion
on the other render it of paramount necessity to settle the
question, and that it is better after all to take the Bill
without the appropriation clause than to let it be again lost.
This difference of opinion has of course particularly embarrassed
Lord John Russell, and they do not know what to do.
With respect to Lord John himself the question is, Can he
continue in office and let the Bill pass without the clause? If
he cannot, are his colleagues as completely committed as he
is, or may not they elect some other leader on his migration,
and take the Bill in that state? I told Tavistock that he well
knew what my opinions had always been with respect to the
introduction of that clause, which seemed to be more fully
justified by the event; that I did not think any difference
could be made between John and his colleagues, and they
must stand or fall together. With respect to their taking
the Bill without the clause, they, and Lord John in particular,
must make up their minds, if they did so, to have every
species of abuse poured upon them from their Tory enemies
and their Radical friends; but they were in a scrape, and
had, in fact, got the country into a scrape too, and their
duty now was to take that course which on the whole seemed
to promise the best results, whatever it might personally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
cost them and to whatever reproaches they might render
themselves liable. If they were satisfied that no other
Government would at present be formed, and that the Irish
Church question could be settled in no other way, they
ought to swallow the pill. He said he thought they were
not indisposed to face the obloquy, if it must be so, and that
all depended upon the conduct of the Lords, and upon their
affording the Government a decent pretext for taking the
Bill. I asked how. He said that what he thought of was
this&mdash;earnestly conjuring me not to commit him and his
friends by saying he had suggested any such thing (which
satisfied me that it was not only his own idea, but that of
others also belonging to the Government)&mdash;that last year
the Lords had thrown out the Bill, because the appropriation
clause being a money clause, they could not touch it, but
that now this objection was removed as to form, and they
were at liberty to cut it out if they pleased, and return the
Bill without it to the Commons; that if they would at the
same time pass a resolution declaring that if any surplus
was reported such surplus should be at the disposal of Parliament,
without expressing any opinion as to the way in
which Parliament should deal with it, this, he thought,
would be sufficient to enable the Whigs <i>salvo honore</i> to take
the Bill; neither party would be compromised or committed
to anything at variance with the principles they had already
professed, and the alteration in the state of the question
produced by the discovery of that legal process to which the
clergy had had recourse would, together with such a resolution,
be a sufficient warrant to them to pass the Bill. I
told him that I would not commit him, and I would endeavour
(if I had an opportunity) to ascertain if there was
any chance of the Lords taking such a course, to which I
could see no objection.</p>

<h3>Petworth, July 24th, 1836</h3>

<p>Came here yesterday from Hillingdon,
the day before from London. In the morning (Friday)
there was a meeting of the Ministerialists at the Foreign
Office; called by Lord John Russell, to talk to them about the
Church Bill. After the skirmish in the House of Commons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE MINISTRY IN DIFFICULTIES.</span>
between him and Charles Buller a deputation, headed by
Hume, waited on Melbourne to remonstrate, and they reported
that the interview was on his part very civil and good-natured,
but very unsatisfactory. Lord John Russell therefore
called them together and harangued them. He is said
to have spoken very well, stating that Government could
not and would not give way with respect to this measure,
and reminding Hume that in a former speech he had already
assented to the principle of the Bill. The English Radicals
were, however, not to be appeased, spoke strongly, and declared
they would oppose the Bill in every stage. O&rsquo;Connell
rose, and said that he would support Government, that
it was of vital consequence to Ireland that there should be
no appearance of disunion in the party, and that no idea
should prevail there that there was a chance of its being
broken up; and for this reason Government should have his
support.</p>

<p>I met them all coming away, and fastened on Tom Duncombe,
who told me what had passed, and how angry they
(the English Radicals) were. I asked him whether their
resentment would induce them to desert Government on the
appropriation clauses and stay away, because, if so, they
must go out; and he said that it would not push them to
that length. It may be presumed that O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s behaviour
at this meeting will have bound the Government still more
not to give way on this clause, and that whatever the Lords
may do, they will fight the battle.</p>

<p>The Lords in the meantime have gone quietly into Committee,
and the second reading passed off with tolerable
harmony. Melbourne made a good speech, and produced a
surplus, but which the Duke of Wellington will take very
good care to reduce again to <i>nil</i>. This is very easily done
on one side, and the contrary on the other; redistribution
can accomplish either desideratum&mdash;surplus or no surplus.
However, the Government seems to be in a pretty state
between their moderate and their violent adherents, and
though they may scramble through this session, and hustle
Parliament to an end, it is difficult to see how they will ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
pass the ordeal of another, for they can neither continue in
their present course nor adopt any other with safety.</p>

<p>I met old Denison (the member for Surrey)&mdash;a strong supporter
of the Government and an old Whig&mdash;coming from
the meeting on Friday, and suggested to him what a scrape
his friends were in. He owned that it was so, but said that
parties were so balanced that Peel could not go on if he
came in. I said Peel could not go on if the King turned
out the Government as he had done before, or if Peel was
instrumental in compelling them to resign; but that if
they resigned of their own accord, and because they were
themselves conscious that they could not go on, I thought
Peel would be supported by a majority even of this House of
Commons; for, after all, the country must have a Government,
and if Peel took it because it was vacant, and nobody
else could be found to occupy it, he could not be refused
the trial, which he had in vain asked for before. He owned
this was true, and such an admission from such a man was a
great deal. The King is evidently waiting with the greatest
impatience for the moment when his Ministers must resign.
He complained bitterly of my
brother-in-law&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_31_04" id="FNA_31_04"></a><a href="#FN_31_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
going abroad,
and said it was a time when every Conservative ought to be
at his post, which means that every opponent of his Ministers
should strive with ceaseless zeal to drive them to the wall.
He is a true king of the Tories, for his impatience fully
equals theirs.</p>

<h3>August 7th, 1836</h3>

<p>After the meeting at the Foreign Office
there seems to have been an end of all notion of any compromise,
or any giving way on the part of the Government
about the clauses in the Tithe Bill, and Lord John Russell
held very strong language. The debate presented nothing
remarkable. Sheil came over from Ireland on purpose to
speak, not being able to vote, as he had paired. Great
exertions were made on both sides, and the Tories dragged
up Sir Watkin Williams Wynn from Wales, very infirm;
and had a blind man in the House, led about by Ross. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISSENSION BETWEEN LORDS AND COMMONS.</span>
majority of twenty-nine ought to have been twenty-six, just
the same as the last division. Sir Charles Cockerell (Whig)
was shut out, whilst on the other side Lord Arthur
Hill&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_31_05" id="FNA_31_05"></a><a href="#FN_31_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
vote was lost by his mother&rsquo;s death, which made him a Peer,
and the Lennoxes and Poyntz stayed away. The whole
thing went off tamely enough; everybody in Parliament
knew what was to happen, and out of doors people don&rsquo;t
care. While the revenue presents an excess of two millions,
and everything flourishes, political excitement is impossible.
The Lords continue to throw out Bills, and many complaints
are made of their evident determination to reject as many of
the Commons&rsquo; measures as they can. Some of them have
been opposed, particularly the Stafford Disfranchisement Bill,
by the Ministers themselves. The Lords, however, no doubt
evince a very imprudent disposition to exercise their power
of rejection without grave and sufficient cause, and needlessly
to expose themselves to the charge of wanton and intemperate
opposition to the measures of the Commons. It is
the height of folly to make the line between the two Houses
as broad as possible, and to publish to the world on every
occasion that the one House is Whig and the other Tory;
not but what (in the present rage for legislation, and the
careless and hurried way in which measures are bustled
through the House of Commons) the revision and watchful
superintendence of the House of Lords are more than ever
necessary.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_31_05" id="FN_31_05"></a><a href="#FNA_31_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[Lord Arthur Hill became Baron Sandys on the death of his mother,
the Marchioness of Downshire, who was Baroness Sandys in her own right.]</p></div>

<p>There was a report of General Evans&rsquo; death the other day,
which was believed for some time, and long enough to show
that there would have been a contest for Westminster if it
had been true.</p>

<p>The accounts from Spain are deplorable, and it is curious
enough that while Palmerston was proclaiming in the House
of Commons his conviction of the ultimate success of the
Christino cause he must have had letters from Villiers in
his pocket telling him that it was almost hopeless. I saw
one from him a few days ago, written in the greatest despondency.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
He said that he had been stopped on his road to St.
Ildefonso by intelligence that the Carlists were approaching
the place, and that the Queen had taken flight. He found
all the relays of mules ready for her Majesty, and he returned
to Madrid. It turned out to be a false alarm, and
the Queen stayed where she was; but he said that he could
only compare the progress of the Carlists to water spreading
over table-land. It will be a severe blow to Palmerston if
this cause is overthrown, though perhaps no fault of his
policy. Had France acted fairly, the result of the Quadruple
Alliance would have answered the expectation of its authors,
but France, instead of co-operating according to the spirit
of that treaty, has thrown every impediment in its way. It
is surprising to hear how Palmerston is spoken of by those
who know him well officially&mdash;the Granvilles, for example.
Lady Granville, a woman expert in judging, thinks his capacity
first-rate; that it approaches to greatness from his
enlarged views, disdain of trivialities, resolution, decision,
confidence, and above all his contempt of clamour and abuse.
She told me that Madame de Flahault had a letter written
by Talleyrand soon after his first arrival in England, in
which he talked with great contempt of the Ministers
generally, Lord Grey included, and said there was but
one statesman among them, and that was Palmerston.
His ordinary conversation exhibits no such superiority;
but when he takes his pen in his hand his intellect seems to
have full play, and probably when engaged exclusively in
business.</p>

<h3>August 13th, 1836</h3>

<p>On Monday last I was riding early in the
Park and met Lord Howick. We rode together for some time.
He said that &lsquo;he supposed they should be out after this
session, and they ought to be out, as they could carry none
of their measures, and the Lords rejected Bill after Bill sent
up from the other House; that since the Tories chose to go
on in this way, they must make the experiment and carry
on the Government if they could, but they must look for
every opposition from his friends and his party. It was
quite impossible things could go on upon their present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PARLIAMENT PROROGUED.</span>
footing; the country would not stand it, and the Lords must
look to those changes which their own conduct rendered
indispensable.&rsquo; I said to Howick that the appropriation
clause made the great difficulty of the Whigs; that I believed
they were, on the whole, a very Conservative Government,
but why struggle for this absurdity, and why not bring
forward a measure at once of real relief and pay the Catholic
clergy? He said they could not do it; their own friends
would not support them; that the Tories might have done it,
but that the Whigs could not. &lsquo;So,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;both parties
are in such a position that no Conservative measures can be
carried but by the Whigs, and no Liberal ones but by the
Tories.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Since this there has been a free conference, and the
Lords have been bowling down Bills like ninepins. This
certainly cannot go on; either the Tories must come into
power again, or the Whigs must do something to control
the House of Lords, or the Lords must lower their tone and
adopt more moderate counsels. The latter would be the
best, as it is the least probable, of the three alternatives.</p>

<p>His Majesty was pleased to be very facetious at the
Council the other day, though not very refined. A new seal
for the Cape of Good Hope was approved, and the impression
represented a Caffre, with some ornaments on his head which
resembled <i>horns</i>. The King asked Lord Glenelg what these
<i>horns</i> meant, but Glenelg referred his Majesty to Poulett
Thomson, to whom he said, &lsquo;Well, Mr. Thomson, what do
you say to this? I know you are a man of gallantry, but if
you choose to be represented with a pair of horns I am sure
I have no objection;&rsquo; at which sally their lordships laughed,
as in duty bound.</p>

<h3>August 21st, 1836</h3>

<p>Yesterday the King prorogued Parliament
with a very moderate, inoffensive Speech. The Tories had
spread a report that the Ministers wanted to thrust into the
Speech some allusions to the conduct of the House of Lords,
but no such thing was ever contemplated.</p>

<p>The session was wound up by an oration of Lyndhurst&rsquo;s in
the House of Lords, introduced with a considerable note of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
preparation. It was announced a day or two before that he
was going down to deliver a vindication of the majority of the
Lords and of himself for their conduct during the session,
and the expectation which was raised was not disappointed.
It seems to have been a great display, and sufficiently well
answered by Melbourne. As his opponents universally admit
that Lyndhurst&rsquo;s speech was of consummate ability, while
his friends confess that it was not discreet and well judged,
we may safely conclude that it deserves both the praise and
the blame; and as the Duke of Wellington rose afterwards
and made a speech of remarkable moderation, it would
certainly appear as if he thought it necessary to temper the
violence of Lyndhurst by a more conciliatory tone. When I
say <i>his friends</i> have expressed the opinions above stated, I
should say that I have conversed with only two&mdash;Lords
Bathurst and Ripon&mdash;and they both expressed themselves to
this effect. Lord Holland, who endeavoured to answer it,
said he thought Lyndhurst&rsquo;s one of the best speeches he had
ever heard in Parliament.</p>

<p>If he had confined himself to a temperate and dignified
vindication of the proceedings of the House of Lords (that
is, of his own), and had abstained from any attack on the
Government, and especially from any language reflecting on
the Commons, perhaps it would have been a wise measure,
but it cannot be wise to widen the differences which
already exist between the two Houses, and to render all the
animosities of public men more bitter and irreconcilable
than they were before. The Tories are convinced that
they are becoming more and more popular, and that the
country approves of the daring behaviour of the Lords.
The Whigs insist that the apathy of the country (which
they mistake for approbation) is nothing but the imperturbability
resulting from prosperity and full employment,
but that if adverse circumstances arise a storm will burst
on the Lords, and they will see how miserably deceived
they are. I think the Lords have gone too far, and though
a vast deal of crude legislation comes up from the Commons,
requiring much supervision, and often great alteration, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MARRIAGE OF LADY AUGUSTA FITZCLARENCE.</span>
have shown an animus and adopted a practice quite foreign
to the usual habits of the House of Lords, and which is in
itself an important innovation. The truth is, it is not (as
has been represented) a contest between <i>the two Houses</i>,
but between the two great <i>parties</i> very nearly balanced, of
which the stronghold of one is in the Lords, and that of the
other in the Commons. It can scarcely cross the minds
of either party, or of any individual of either, that the substantive
power of Government can or ought to be transferred
from the House of Commons to the House of Lords, and
Lyndhurst and the Tories would not venture to make the
havoc which they do in the Government Bills if they were
not persuaded that if ever a crisis is produced by the collision
their party will succeed in obtaining the sanction of
the country and an ascendency in the other House. If
they have estimated correctly their own strength and the
real disposition of the country, their Parliamentary tactics
have been skilful, but the game which they play is a very
desperate one, for if it fails the House of Lords can hardly
avoid suffering very materially from the conflict. However,
much is to be said on the subject when considered in all
its bearings.</p>

<p>The King at his last levee received Dr. Allen to do
homage for the see of Ely, when he said to him, &lsquo;My Lord,
I do not mean to interfere in any way with your vote in
Parliament except on one subject, <i>the Jews</i>, and I trust I
may depend on your always voting against them.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>August 30th, 1836</h3>

<p>At Hillingdon from Saturday to Monday.
There were great festivities at Windsor during the Egham
race week, when the King&rsquo;s daughter Lady Augusta was
married at the
Castle<a name="FNA_31_06" id="FNA_31_06"></a><a href="#FN_31_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
It was remarked that on the King&rsquo;s
birthday not one of the Ministers was invited to the Castle,
and none except the Household in any way connected with
the Government. At the Queen&rsquo;s birthday a short time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
before not one individual of that party was present. Nothing
can be more undisguised than the King&rsquo;s aversion to his
Ministers, and he seems resolved to intimate that his compulsory
reception of them shall not extend to his society, and
that though he can&rsquo;t help seeing them at St. James&rsquo;s, the
gates of Windsor are shut against them. All his habitual
guests are of the Tory party, and generally those who have
distinguished themselves by their violence or are noted for
their extreme opinions&mdash;Winchilsea and Wharncliffe, for
example, of the former, and the Duke of Dorset of the latter
sort. At the dinner on his birthday the King gave the
Princess Victoria&rsquo;s health rather well. Having given the
Princess Augusta&rsquo;s he said, &lsquo;And now, having given the
health of the oldest, I will give that of the youngest member
of the Royal Family. I know the interest which the public
feel about her, and although <i>I have not seen so much of her
as I could have wished</i>, I take no less interest in her, and
the more I do see of her, both in public and in private, the
greater pleasure it will give me.&rsquo; The whole thing was so
civil and gracious that it could hardly be taken ill, but the
young Princess sat opposite, and hung her head with not
unnatural modesty at being thus talked of in so large a
company.</p>

Mrs. Jordan, married first, on the 5th of July, 1827 to the Hon. John Kennedy

Gordon. She died in 1865.]</p></div>

<p>While London is entirely deserted, and everything is
quiet and prosperous here, there is a storm raging in Spain
which has already had an effect in France, by producing the
dissolution of Thiers&rsquo;s

creating disturbances in that country and embroiling Europe.
The complication of French politics, the character and designs
of the King, his relations with the great Powers of Europe,
and the personal danger to which he is exposed from the
effects of a demoralised mass of floating hostility and disaffection,
rendered doubly perilous from the mixture of unnatural
excitement and contempt of life which largely enter into it,
present a very curious and very interesting subject of political
observation and speculation for those who have the means
of investigating it closely.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_31_07" id="FN_31_07"></a><a href="#FNA_31_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[M. Thiers came into power for the first time as Minister of Foreign
Affairs and head of the Government on the 22nd of February, 1836. He had
boasted that he should be able to engage the King in a more active intervention
in Spain in favour of the young Queen&mdash;&lsquo;Nous entraînerons le Roi&rsquo; was
his expression&mdash;but in this he was deceived, and his Administration came to
a speedy termination. Lord Palmerston proposed on the 14th of March that
some of the ports on the coast of Biscay should be occupied by British seamen
and marines, and that Passages, Fontarabia, and the valley of Bartan should
be occupied by the French. This scheme was strenuously opposed by the
King, though M. Thiers was willing to assent to it. The Revolution of La
Granja in August only increased the repugnance of Louis Philippe to interfere
actively in Spain, and early in September the Thiers Cabinet was dissolved.
Mr. Villiers&rsquo;s narrative of the revolution of La Granja is alluded
to in the passage next following.]</p></div>

<h3>September 7th, 1836</h3>

<p>Mrs. Villiers sent me to-day the copies
of two despatches of George Villiers&rsquo;s to Palmerston, containing
a narrative of the events which took place at St.
Ildefonso on the 12th, 13th, and 14th of last month;
these he sent to her, because he had not time to write the
details all over again. Nothing can be more curious, nothing
more interesting, nothing more admirably described, all the
details given with great simplicity, extreme clearness, and
inimitable liveliness of narration. It reminds one of the
scenes enacted during the French Revolution; but as these
despatches will probably be published, I shall not be at the
pains to give an analysis of them here. It is remarkable
how courageously and prudently the Queen seems to have
behaved. What energies a difficult crisis called forth!
How her spirit and self-possession bore up in the midst of
danger and insult, and how she contrived to preserve her
dignity even while compelled to make the most humiliating
concessions! No romance was ever more interesting than
this narrative. George Villiers&rsquo;s correspondence will some
day or other make one of the most valuable and entertaining
publications that ever appeared, though I shall not live to
see it. He writes incomparably well, with a mixture of
vivacity and energy peculiarly his own.</p>

<h3>September 21st, 1836</h3>

<p>I have recorded nothing about the
revolutions at Madrid and Lisbon, because I know nothing
besides what has appeared in all the newspapers, and it
would be very useless to copy facts from their columns.
As to private matters, and the exploits or interests of individuals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
I only note them as the fancy takes me, and the
fancy has not taken me of late. I cannot keep a <i>journal</i>&mdash;that
is, a day by day memorial&mdash;and I have an invincible
repugnance to making my MS. books the receptacles of
scandal, and handing down to posterity (if ever posterity
should have an opportunity of seeing and would take the
trouble to read these pages) the <i>private</i> faults and follies of
my friends, acquaintance, and associates.</p>

<p>To-day we had a Council, the first since Parliament was
prorogued, when his most gracious Majesty behaved most
ungraciously to his confidential servants, whom he certainly
does not delight to honour. The last article on the list was
a petition of Admiral Sartorius praying to be restored to his
rank, and when this was read the King, after repeating the
usual form of words, added, &lsquo;And must be granted. As
Captain Napier was restored, so must this gentleman be,
for there was this difference between their cases: Admiral
Napier knew he was doing wrong, which Admiral Sartorius
was not aware of.&rsquo; Lord Minto said, &lsquo;I believe, sir, there
was not so much difference between the two cases as your
Majesty imagines, for Admiral Sartorius&mdash;&rsquo; Then followed
something which I could not catch, but the King did, for he
said, with considerable asperity, &lsquo;Unless your Lordship is
quite sure of that, I must beg leave to say that I differ from
you and do not believe it to be so, but since you have expressed
your belief that it is so, I desire you will furnish me
with proofs of it immediately. The next time I see you
you will be prepared with the proofs of what you say, for
unless I see them I shall not believe one word of it.&rsquo;
Minto made no reply to this extraordinary sortie, and the
rest looked at each other in silence.</p>

<p>This, however, was nothing compared with what took
place at Windsor with the Duchess of Kent, of which I heard
something a long time ago (August 30th), but never the particulars
till last night. It is very remarkable that the thing
has not been more talked about. The King invited the
Duchess of Kent to go to Windsor on the 12th of August to
celebrate the Queen&rsquo;s birthday (13th), and to stay there over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RUDENESS OF THE KING.</span>
his own birthday, which was to be kept (<i>privately</i>) on the
21st (the real day, but falling on Sunday) and <i>publicly</i> the
day following. She sent word that she wanted to keep her
own birthday at Claremont on the 15th (or whatever the day
is), took no notice of the Queen&rsquo;s birthday, but said she would
go to Windsor on the 20th. This put the King in a fury;
he made, however, no reply, and on the 20th he was in town
to prorogue Parliament, having desired that they would not
wait dinner for him at Windsor. After the prorogation he
went to Kensington Palace to look about it; when he got
there he found that the Duchess of Kent had appropriated
to her own use a suite of apartments, seventeen in number,
for which she had applied last year, and which he had refused
to let her have. This increased his ill-humour, already excessive.
When he arrived at Windsor and went into the
drawing-room (at about ten o&rsquo;clock at night), where the whole
party was assembled, he went up to the Princess Victoria,
took hold of both her hands, and expressed his pleasure at
seeing her there and his regret at not seeing her oftener.
He then turned to the Duchess and made her a low bow,
almost immediately after which he said that &lsquo;a most unwarrantable
liberty had been taken with one of his palaces;
that he had just come from Kensington, where he found
apartments had been taken possession of not only without
his consent, but contrary to his commands, and that he
neither understood nor would endure conduct so disrespectful
to him.&rsquo; This was said loudly, publicly, and in a tone of
serious displeasure. It was, however, only the muttering of
the storm which was to break the next day. Adolphus
Fitzclarence went into his room on Sunday morning, and
found him in a state of great excitement. It was his birthday,
and though the celebration was what was called private,
there were a hundred people at dinner, either belonging to
the Court or from the neighbourhood. The Duchess of Kent
sat on one side of the King and one of his sisters on the
other, the Princess Victoria opposite. Adolphus Fitzclarence
sat two or three from the Duchess, and heard every word of
what passed. After dinner, by the Queen&rsquo;s desire, &lsquo;His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Majesty&rsquo;s health, and long life to him&rsquo; was given, and as soon
as it was drunk he made a very long speech, in the course of
which he poured forth the following extraordinary and <i>foudroyante</i>
tirade:&mdash;&lsquo;I trust in God that my life may be spared
for nine months longer, after which period, in the event of
my death, no regency would take place. I should then have
the satisfaction of leaving the royal authority to the personal
exercise of that young lady (pointing to the Princess),
the heiress presumptive of the Crown, and not in the hands
of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers
and who is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the
station in which she would be placed. I have no hesitation
in saying that I have been insulted&mdash;grossly and continually
insulted&mdash;by that person, but I am determined to endure
no longer a course of behaviour so disrespectful to me.
Amongst many other things I have particularly to complain
of the manner in which that young lady has been kept away
from my Court; she has been repeatedly kept from my
drawing-rooms, at which she ought always to have been present,
but I am fully resolved that this shall not happen
again. I would have her know that I am King, and I am
determined to make my authority respected, and for the
future I shall insist and command that the Princess do upon
all occasions appear at my Court, as it is her duty to do.&rsquo;
He terminated his speech by an allusion to the Princess and
her future reign in a tone of paternal interest and affection,
which was excellent in its way.</p>

<p>This awful philippic (with a great deal more which I
forget) was uttered with a loud voice and excited manner.
The Queen looked in deep distress, the Princess burst into
tears, and the whole company were aghast. The Duchess of
Kent said not a word. Immediately after they rose and
retired, and a terrible scene ensued; the Duchess announced
her immediate departure and ordered her carriage, but a
sort of reconciliation was patched up, and she was prevailed
upon to stay till the next day. The following morning,
when the King saw Adolphus, he asked him what people
said to his speech.  He  replied that they thought the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING AND THE DUCHESS OF KENT.</span>
Duchess of Kent merited his rebuke, but that it ought not
to have been given there; that he ought to have sent for her
into his closet, and have said all that he felt and thought
there, but not at table before a hundred people. He replied
that he did not care where he said it or before whom, that
&lsquo;by God he had been insulted by her in a measure that was
past all endurance, and he would not stand it any longer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nothing can be more unaccountable than the Duchess of
Kent&rsquo;s behaviour to the King, nothing more reprehensible;
but his behaviour to her has always been as injudicious and
undignified as possible, and this last sortie was monstrous.
It was his duty and his right to send for her, and signify to
her both his displeasure at the past and his commands
for the future; but such a gross and public insult offered to
her at his own table, sitting by his side and in the presence
of her daughter, admits of no excuse. It was an unparalleled
outrage from a man to a woman, from a host to his guest,
and to the last degree unbecoming the station they both
of them fill. He has never had the firmness and decision
of character a due display of which would have obviated
the necessity of such bickerings, and his passion leads him
to these indecent exhibitions, which have not the effect of
correcting, and cannot fail to have that of exasperating
her, and rendering their mutual relations more hopelessly
disagreeable.</p>

<h3>November 7th, 1836</h3>

<p>An interval of above six weeks. I went
to Newmarket on the 3rd of October, returned to town for
a Council on Wednesday in the first October week; after the
first October meeting I went to Buckenham, after the
second to Euston, and after the third came to town. At
Buckenham I met Adolphus Fitzclarence, who told me over
again the particulars of the scene with the Duchess of
Kent, which did not differ materially from what I have put
down. He added one item, that the day following the
Queen was not ready for dinner, and when dinner was announced
and he was waiting he asked, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the Queen?&rsquo;
They told him she was waiting for the Duchess of Kent,
when he said, loud enough for everybody to hear, &lsquo;That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
woman is a nuisance.&rsquo; He was very angry at King Leopold&rsquo;s
coming here, received him very coldly at Windsor, had no
conversation with him on business, and on one occasion
exhibited a rudeness even to brutality. It seems he hates
water-drinkers; God knows why. One day at dinner Leopold
called for water, when the King asked, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that
you are drinking, sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;Water, sir.&rsquo; &lsquo;God damn it!&rsquo; rejoined
the other King; &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you drink wine? I
never allow anybody to drink water at my table.&rsquo; Leopold
only dined there, and went away in the evening. All this
is very miserable and disgraceful.</p>

<p>Of politics during this period I have heard little or nothing,
except that while the Conservatives are feasting and
spouting in all parts of the country, and rallying their forces,
there is a split among their opponents, an event which was
inevitable, considering the different shades of opinion prevailing
amongst them, though they hope to reconcile all
their differences by the time Parliament meets, which they
will probably do, in order to baffle their common enemy. It
is, however, a good thing that these differences should arise
amongst them. I wish I could see a party formed upon
really Conservative principles, determined to maintain the
Constitution and steer clear of Tory nonsense and bigotry;
but this I doubt to be practicable.</p>

<h3>November 8th, 1836</h3>

<p>I dined on Sunday with Cunningham, and
met Prince Esterhazy, with whom I had a long conversation.
He talked a great deal about the state of Europe, of the
bickerings between Palmerston and Louis Philippe on the
Spanish question, between England and Russia in the East,
and of the position of Austria in the midst of it all; that he
had conversed often and at great length with the Emperor
of Russia at Prague and with Louis Philippe at Paris, both
having talked in the most open manner, and that he was
endeavouring (he thought successfully) to bring Palmerston
to an amicable tone and feeling, and to effect some sort of
compromise with respect to the debated points. Both sovereigns
have the same desire to avoid war, and Louis Philippe
told him that his object was &lsquo;de rendre la guerre impossible,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PRINCE ESTERHAZY&rsquo;S CONVERSATION.</span>
that no Power could be so much interested as Austria was
in restraining the power and ambition of Russia within
reasonable bounds, and that the Emperor had held the most
moderate language, as he believed with sincerity; that our
prejudices against Russia were unreasonably violent, and
they arose in some degree from mortification at our own
misconduct in letting opportunities slip out of our hands,
and throwing advantages and influence into those of Russia,
which we were now angry that she availed herself of; but
that if we continued to act frankly and firmly in conjunction
with Austria and France (France and Austria being perfectly
agreed) we should have nothing to fear from Russia.
They (the northern Powers) were content that we should
exercise an especial influence in the Peninsula; they were
aware that these questions were the peculiar concern and
interest of France and England, and they did not want to
interfere. But for the escape of Don Carlos, which altered
the aspect of affairs in Spain, and some trifling points of
etiquette which might easily have been adjusted, the Spanish
question would have been settled among the Powers long
ago, and the Queen recognised by them all. He said that
for a long time past the affairs of Europe had been extensively
influenced by personal feelings and individual interests
and passions, greatly so on Palmerston&rsquo;s own part and very
much during the embassy of the Lievens, Madame de Lieven
having been so much influenced by partisanship and by her
fluctuating friendships and connections. The Emperor told
Esterhazy that it was impossible for him to leave Lieven
there, that he was not represented by him as he ought to be,
that they in some respects fell short of, and in others went
beyond, the line which their duty and his interests demanded.
He said that the Emperor Nicholas was a very remarkable
man&mdash;absolute master, his own Minister, and under no other
influence whatever&mdash;that his perceptions were just and his
ideas remarkably clear, although his views were not very
extensive, and the circle within which these ideas ranged
was limited, Nesselrode not having a particle of influence;
his Ministers and Ambassadors were clerks; and while his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
ease and affability to foreigners (to him&mdash;Esterhazy&mdash;in particular)
were excessively striking, he treated his Russians
with a loftiness that could not be conceived, and one and
all trembled in his presence with the crouching humility of
slaves. When he was at Prague he on a sudden set off and
travelled with amazing rapidity to Vienna, without giving
any notice to anybody. His object was to visit the Dowager
Empress and the tomb of the late Emperor. He alighted at
Tatischef&rsquo;s (his Ambassador&rsquo;s), where, as soon as his arrival
was known, the Russian ladies who were at Vienna full-dressed
themselves and hurried off to pay their <i>devoirs</i>. They
were met in all their diamonds and feathers on the staircase
by Benkendorf, who said, &lsquo;Allez-vous en bien vite; l&rsquo;Empereur
ne veut pas voir une seule de vous,&rsquo; and they were
obliged to bustle back with as much alacrity as they had
come. Though the best understanding prevailed between
the French and Austrian Governments, and the latter is
cordially allied with Louis Philippe, there is some sourness
and disappointment at the failure of the project of marriage
with which the Duke of Orleans went to Vienna. Esterhazy
said that it had failed in great measure through an imprudent
precipitation; that the Duke had given universal satisfaction,
but there were great prejudices to surmount, and
the recollection of Marie Antoinette and Marie Louise. He
thought the advantages of the match were overrated at
Paris, but they were so anxious for it there that the disappointment
was considerable; he said he thought that it
might still be brought about. These are the few fragments
I have retained from the talk we had.</p>

<h3>November 13th, 1836</h3>

<p>Nomination of the sheriffs yesterday.
Two of the judges&mdash;old Park and Alderson&mdash;would not send
me their lists, nonsensically alleging that it was unconstitutional;
all the others
did.<a name="FNA_31_08" id="FNA_31_08"></a><a href="#FN_31_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Old Park is peevish and foolish.
The Ministers are come to town, having enough upon their
hands; the war in Spain, and approaching downfall of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">GLOOMY PROSPECTS.</span>
Christino cause, will be a blow which will shake Palmerston&rsquo;s
credit severely, and many think will force him to retire,
which, however, I do not expect. Then the nervousness in
the City about the monetary state, the disappearance of gold,
the cessation of orders from America, and the consequent
interruption to trade, and dismissal of thousands of workmen
who have been thrown out of employment, present the prospect
of a disquieting winter. It is remarkable that all
accounts agree in stating that so great is the improvidence
of the artisans and manufacturing labourers, that none of
those who have been in the receipt of the highest wages have
saved anything against the evil days with which they are
menaced. Rice affected to be very cheerful yesterday, and said
it would all come right. A good deal of alarm, however,
prevails in what are called practical quarters. Then there
is a split among the Radicals, some of whom are dissatisfied
that Government will not take up their views, and others are
affronted at the personal neglect or incivility which they
have experienced. As the Ministers disclaim any connection
with the Radicals, while existing upon their support, they
think it necessary in proof of the first to exclude them from
any participation in those social civilities which Ministers
usually dispense to their adherents, and as these patriots are
not free from the same stirrings of pride and vanity which
are found in other men, they are mortified and disgusted, as
well as indignant, at such unworthy usage; they will, however,
smooth their ruffled plumage before Parliament meets,
for they must support the present Government, and Government
will perhaps be a little more cordial, as they can&rsquo;t do without
these allies.</p>

<h3>November 17th, 1836</h3>

<p>I have had two other conversations with
Esterhazy at different times. He went to Brighton and saw
the King, whom he thought much <i>baissé</i>, but I do not know
whether it is a proof of it that he could not prevail upon his
Majesty to enter upon foreign politics with him. He repeated
to me what he had said before of the necessity of a strict
and cordial union between Austria and England, and the
disposition of the former not to contest our supremacy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
influence in the Peninsula, but he harps upon the <i>mode</i> of
doing this, which I don&rsquo;t quite understand. I gathered from
him, and have heard from other quarters, that Metternich&rsquo;s
influence is much diminished, and that the Austrian Cabinet
is no longer ruled by him as heretofore, and that there is not
the same union: but there would appear to be a very complete
union in the Austrian Imperial Family, who cling together
from a sense of their common interest, and in great
measure from the respect and attachment which they all feel
for the memory of the late Emperor. Esterhazy said it
was remarkable, considering the condition of the Imperial
House&mdash;the
Emperor<a name="FNA_31_09" id="FNA_31_09"></a><a href="#FN_31_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
in a state bordering on idiocy, not
likely to live above four or five years at the outside, and his
uncles all men of talent and energy; the next heir, the
brother of the
Emperor,<a name="FNA_31_10" id="FNA_31_10"></a><a href="#FN_31_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
is a man of competent sense, but
the late Emperor&rsquo;s brothers he describes to be all superior
men.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_31_09" id="FN_31_09"></a><a href="#FNA_31_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[The Emperor Ferdinand, here described, filled the throne until 1848,
when he abdicated in the great convulsion of that year; he spent the rest of
his life in retirement at Prague, but he survived this prediction nearly forty
years.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_31_10" id="FN_31_10"></a><a href="#FNA_31_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[The Archduke Franz Joseph, father of the present Emperor. But
this Archduke never filled the throne.]</p></div>

<p>He told me a great deal about the Duke of Reichstadt,
who, if he had lived, would have probably played a great
part in the world. He died of a premature decay, brought
on apparently by over-exertion and over-excitement; his
talents were very conspicuous, he was <i>pétri d&rsquo;ambition</i>,
worshipped the memory of his father, and for that reason
never liked his mother; his thoughts were incessantly turned
towards France, and when he heard of the days of July he
said, &lsquo;Why was I not there to take my chance?&rsquo; He
evinced great affection and gratitude to his grandfather, who,
while he scrupulously observed all his obligations towards
Louis Philippe, could not help feeling a secret pride in the
aspiring genius and ambition of Napoleon&rsquo;s son. He was
well educated, and day and night pored over the history of
his father&rsquo;s glorious career. He delighted in military
exercises, and not only shone at the head of his regiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE OF REICHSTADT.</span>
but had already acquired the hereditary art of ingratiating
himself with the soldiers. Esterhazy told me one anecdote
in particular, which shows the absorbing passion of
his soul overpowering the usual propensities of his age. He
was to make his first appearance in public at a ball at Lady
Cowley&rsquo;s (to which he had shown great anxiety to go), and
was burning with impatience to amuse himself with dancing
and flirting with the beauties he had admired in the Prater.
He went, but there he met two French marshals&mdash;Marmont
and Maison. He had no eyes or ears but for them; from nine
in the evening to five the next morning he devoted himself to
these marshals, and conversed with them without ceasing.
Though he knew well enough all the odium that attached to
Marmont, he said to him that he was too happy to have the
opportunity of making the acquaintance of one who had been
among his father&rsquo;s earliest companions, and who could tell
him so many interesting details of his earlier days. Marmont
subsequently either did give or was to have given him lessons
in strategy.</p>

<h2>1837.</h2>

<h3>January 6th, 1837</h3>

<p>I met Robarts at dinner yesterday, who
gave me an account of the alarm which has recently pervaded
the City about monetary matters, from the low state of the
exchanges, the efflux of gold, and the confusion produced by
the embarrassments of the Great Northern and Central
Bank. These financial details are not peculiarly interesting
in themselves, and are only worth noticing from the light
they throw upon the capacity of our rulers, and the estimation
in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is held among
the great moneyed
authorities.<a name="FNA_32_01" id="FNA_32_01"></a><a href="#FN_32_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Nothing can in fact be
lower than it is. Robarts, a staunch Whig and thick and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.</span>
thin supporter of Government, told me that he was quite
unequal to the situation he held; that these embarrassments
had been predicted to him, and the remedy pointed out long
ago by practical men; that the most eminent bankers in the
City&mdash;Patterson the Governor of the Bank, Grote, Glyn,
himself, and others&mdash;had successively been consulted by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and they had all expressed the
same opinion and given the same advice; but that he had
met their conclusions with a long chain of reasoning founded
upon the most fallacious premises, columns of prices of
stocks and exchequer-bills in former years, and calculations
and conjectures upon these data, which the keen view and
sagacious foresight of these men (whose wits are sharpened
by the magnitude of their immediate interest in the results,
and whose long habits make them so familiar with the details)
detected and exposed, not without some feelings both
of resentment and contempt for the Minister who clung to
his own theories in preference to their practical conclusions.
What they originally advised Rice to do was to raise the
interest on exchequer-bills, which he refused, and afterwards
was compelled to do. Robarts said he had no doubt that if
Peel had been in office he would have shown himself equal
to cope with the difficulty which Rice had proved himself so
incompetent to meet. The raising of the siege of Bilbao
will have given Palmerston a lift, but between our foreign
and our financial affairs the Ministers will not have an easy
session of the next.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_32_01" id="FN_32_01"></a><a href="#FNA_32_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Mr. Spring Rice was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s
second Administration until 1839, when he was raised to the peerage under
the title of Lord Monteagle of Brandon.</p></div>

<h3>Dover, January 12th, 1837</h3>

<p>Having resolved, after many
struggles, to go to Paris, here I am on my way, and on
arriving find that it blows a hurricane, and there is little or
no chance of being able to cross to-morrow; for all I know
I may be kept here for the next three days.</p>

<h3>January 13th, 1837</h3>

<p>I might have gone very well this morning,
but was persuaded not to start by the mate of the Government
packet, and, like a fool, I listened to him. It was a fine
calm morning.</p>

<h3>Paris, January 17th, 1837</h3>

<p>Arrived here last night at five,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
having left Dover at a quarter to one the day before; three
hours to Boulogne, twenty-two to Paris.</p>

<p>I made a very prosperous journey; went to the Embassy
in the evening, and found a heap of people&mdash;Molé, Montalivet,
Lyndhurst, Madame de Lieven, Madame de Dino,
Talleyrand, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>Paris, January 19th, 1837</h3>

<p>On Tuesday went about visiting;
found nobody but Madame Alfred de Noailles and Raikes;
was to have gone to the Chamber, but the ticket did not
arrive in time; dined at the Embassy. Wednesday, in the
morning, to the gallery of the Louvre; dined with Talleyrand;
to Madame de Lieven&rsquo;s and Madame Graham&rsquo;s.
Talleyrand as well as ever, except weaker on his legs; asked
me to dine there whenever I was not engaged. In the
morning called at the Tuileries, and left a note for the Duke
of Orleans&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, asking to be presented to his
Royal Highness; and at night my mother went to Court,
and begged leave to bring me there to present me to the
Royal family. Lyndhurst sets off to London this morning,
and I had only an opportunity of exchanging a few words
with him. He told me he had never passed such an agreeable
time as the last four months; not a moment of <i>ennui</i>;
had become acquainted with a host of remarkable people of
all sorts, political characters of all parties, and the <i>littérateurs</i>,
such as Victor Hugo, Balzac, &amp;c., the latter of whom, he
says, is a very agreeable man. He told me that &lsquo;Le Père
Goriot&rsquo; is a true story, and that since its publication he had
become acquainted with some more circumstances which
would have made it still more striking. He has been leading
here &lsquo;une vie de garçon,&rsquo; and making himself rather
ridiculous in some respects. He said to me, &lsquo;I suppose
the Government will get on; I&rsquo;m sure I shall not go on
in the House of Lords this year as I did the last. I was
induced by circumstances and some little excitement to take
a more prominent part than usual last session; but I don&rsquo;t
see what I got by it except abuse. I thought I should not
hear any of the abuse that was poured upon me when I
came here, and got out of the reach of the English newspapers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PRINCESS LIEVEN IN PARIS.</span>
but, on the contrary, I find it all concentrated in
Galignani.&rsquo; Lyndhurst and Ellice have been great friends
here. Madame de Lieven seems to have a very agreeable
position at Paris. She receives every night, and opens her
house to all comers. Being neutral ground, men of all
parties meet there, and some of the most violent antagonists
have occasionally joined in amicable and curious discussion.
It is probably convenient to her Court that she should be
here under such circumstances, for a woman of her talents
cannot fail to pick up a good deal of interesting, and perhaps
useful, information; and as she is not subject to the operation
of the same passions and prejudices which complicated
and disturbed her position in England, she is able to form a
juster estimate of the characters and the objects of public
men. She says Paris is a very agreeable place to live at,
but expresses an unbounded contempt for the French character,
and her lively sense of the moral superiority of England.
I asked her who were the men whom she was best
inclined to praise. She likes Molé, as pleasing, intelligent,
and gentlemanlike; Thiers the most brilliant, very lively
and amusing; Guizot and Berryer, both very remarkable.
She talked freely enough of Ellice, who is her dear friend,
and from whom she draws all she can of English politics;
that he had come here for the purpose of intriguing against
the present Government, and trying to set up Thiers again,
and that he had fancied he should manage it.
Molé<a name="FNA_32_02" id="FNA_32_02"></a><a href="#FN_32_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
was
fully aware of it, and felt towards him accordingly. Lord
Granville, who was attached to the Duc de Broglie, and therefore
violently opposed to Thiers, when he became Minister,
soon became even more partial to Thiers, which sudden turn
was the more curious, because such had been their original
antipathy that Lady Granville had been personally uncivil to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Madame Thiers, so much so that Thiers had said to Madame
de Lieven, that &lsquo;he would have her to know it was not to be
endured that an Ambassadress should behave with such
marked incivility to the wife of the Prime Minister, and if
she chose to continue so to do she might get her husband
sent away.&rsquo; The other replied, &lsquo;Monsieur Thiers, if you say
this to me with the intention of its being repeated to Lady
Granville, I tell you you must go elsewhere for the purpose,
for I do not intend to do so.&rsquo; I asked her whether it had
been repeated, and she said she thought probably it had
been through Ellice for soon after all was smiles and civility
between them. She talked a great deal about England, and
of the ignorance of the French about it; that Molé, for
example, had said, &lsquo;It is true that we are not in an agreeable
state, but England is in a still worse.&rsquo; The King,
however, is of a different opinion, and appears better to
understand the nature of our system. She described him
(Molé) as not the cleverest and most brilliant, but by
far the most sensible, sound, and well-judging man of
them all.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_32_02" id="FN_32_02"></a><a href="#FNA_32_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[M. Molé was then Prime Minister. The overthrow of M. Thiers on
the Spanish question had been regarded as a check by the English Government,
and Mr. Ellice was a cordial friend and supporter of Thiers. The
resentment of Lord Palmerston at the refusal of the King to support the
cause of the Queen in Spain by a direct intervention, was the commencement
of that coolness which is noticed further on, and which led eventually
to most important results.]</p></div>

<p>Peel&rsquo;s Glasgow speeches arrived yesterday, that is, were
in general circulation, for the King received on the 16th a
newspaper containing the speech made there on the 13th, an
instance (as it seems to me) of unexampled rapidity. Lord
Granville, who praises anything against his own party very
reluctantly, told me he thought Peel&rsquo;s speech at the dinner
very dexterous, and Ellice said, though there was nothing
new in it, he thought it would produce a great effect.</p>

<h3>January 20th, 1837</h3>

<p>Yesterday went about visiting, found
Montrond ill. Sat a long time with Lady Granville, who
was very amusing, and told me a great deal about the characters
of the people and the <i>tracasseries</i> in society; dined
at the Club, and at night to Madame de Lieven&rsquo;s, where I
found Berryer, a remarkable-looking man, but not like what
I expected: dark, stout, countenance very intelligent, with a
cheerful, cunning, and rather leering look, such as a clever
Irish priest might have, neither in look nor manner very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISLIKE OF PARIS.</span>
refined. He soon went away, so I heard nothing of his
conversation. Everybody I have met has been very civil and
obliging, and I ought to be and am grateful for my reception,
but I wish myself back again, and ask myself a hundred
times why I came. It is tiresome to go through introductions
to a parcel of people whom I shall probably never see
again, whose names I can scarcely remember, and with whom,
be they ever so agreeable, I have not time to form any intimacy.
They all ask the same question, &lsquo;Do you make a
long stay here?&rsquo; to which I universally reply, &lsquo;As long as I
can,&rsquo; which, being interpreted, means, I shall be off as soon
as I can find a decent pretext. It may be a very delightful
place to <i>live at</i>, but for a flying visit (as at present inclined),
I don&rsquo;t think it answers.</p>

<h3>January 21st and 22nd, 1837</h3>

<p>Walked about and rejoiced in the
Madeleine, which is alone worth coming to Paris to see. Greece
and Rome in the days of their glory never erected a grander
temple. I find Paris tolerable, and that is all. Dined with
Madame de Noailles at the Hôtel de Poix, then to the Opera.
On the 22nd, I walked to the Arc de Triomphe, wonderfully
fine, and clambered to the top. The view is well worth the
trouble, and above all the Madeleine is seen to great advantage
from the elevation; all its fine proportions strikingly
developed, and bringing to my mind the Temple of Neptune
at Pæstum. Dined at the Embassy, where was nobody of
note but M. de Broglie, and then to Madame de Lieven&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3>January 23rd, 1837</h3>

<p>Rained all day, dined at the Grahams, with
Madame de Lieven and many people of no note, and went
afterwards to Madame de Flahault&rsquo;s beautiful house, where
was all the fashion of France of the Liberal and Royal
faction; no Carlists. Some very handsome women, particularly
the Duchesse d&rsquo;Istria.</p>

<p>Ellice told me that his letters from England announced
smooth water between Whigs and Radicals, and that the
latter were coming up to support the Government in good
humour. The event here in these last days has been the
acquittal of the Strasburg prisoners, of military men taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
in the commission of overt acts of mutiny and high
treason.<a name="FNA_32_03" id="FNA_32_03"></a><a href="#FN_32_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
By the law, when military men and civilians are indicted for
the same offence, the former cannot be brought before a
court-martial, but must be tried by a jury; the jury decide
according to their feelings or their prejudices, and appear to
care nothing for the law, and an Alsatian jury is said to be
republican. These men were therefore acquitted against the
clearest and most undoubted evidence, and their acquittal
was hailed as a triumph. It produces considerable annoyance
and surprise, but not so great a sensation as I should
have expected.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_32_03" id="FN_32_03"></a><a href="#FNA_32_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[These were the accomplices of Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte in
his first attempt made at Strasburg on the 30th of November 1836. The
Prince himself was sent off to the United States in a French frigate.
His accomplices were tried at Colmar in the ordinary course of law, and
acquitted by the jury, who refused to convict them when the head of the
conspiracy was not brought to trial.]</p></div>

<p>There appears to be something rotten in the state of this
country; the system stands on unstable foundations, the
people are demoralised, in vain we look for fixed principles
or deep convictions. Some are indifferent to the fate of the
monarchy because they hate the monarch, others rejoice at
attempts on the monarch from aversion to monarchy, and as
far as my cursory observation and casual observation instruct
me, I see only a confusion and caprice of passions, prejudices,
and opinions, which are only reduced to anything like order
by the strong sober sense and the firmness of the King, who
is by far the ablest man among them.</p>

<h3>January 25th, 1836</h3>

<p>On the 24th I walked about Paris, dined
at the Embassy, and went to Court at night; about fifty
English, forty Americans, and several other foreigners were
presented. The Palace is very magnificent; the present King
has built a new staircase, which makes the suite of rooms
continuous, and the whole has been regilt and painted. We
were arranged in the throne-room by nations, the English
first, and at a quarter before nine the doors of the royal
apartments were opened, and the Royal Family came forth.
We all stood in a long line (single file) reaching through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RECEPTION AND BALL AT THE TUILERIES.</span>
two rooms, beginning and ending again at the door of the
King&rsquo;s apartment. The King walked down the line attended
by Lord Granville, then the Queen with the eldest Princess
under her arm, then Madame Adélaïde with the other, and
then the Duke of Orleans.
Aston<a name="FNA_32_04" id="FNA_32_04"></a><a href="#FN_32_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
attended the Queen, and
the <i>attachés</i> the others. They all speak to each individual,
and by some strange stretch of invention find something to
say. The King is too civil; he has a fine head, and closely
resembles the pictures of Louis XIV. The Queen is very
gracious and dignified, Adélaïde very good-humoured, and
the Duke of Orleans extremely princely in his manners.
This morning I went to the Tuileries by appointment, when
he received me, kept me for a quarter of an hour talking
about race-horses, and invited me to breakfast on Saturday,
and to go with him to Meudon to see his stud.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_32_04" id="FN_32_04"></a><a href="#FNA_32_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[The British Secretary of Embassy, afterwards Sir Arthur Aston.]</p></div>

<p>Then I went sight-seeing; to the Invalides, the Pantheon,
and the Madeleine. The former is very well worth seeing,
and nothing is more remarkable than the kitchen, which
is the sweetest and the cleanest I ever saw. The Chapel
is fine, with no remarkable tombs except those of Turenne
and Vauban. The Pantheon is under repair; there are the
tombs of Voltaire and Rousseau. The interior of the Madeleine
is very rich, but it is inferior to the outside; the simple
grandeur of the latter is somewhat frittered away in the
minute ornaments and the numerous patches of coloured
marble of the Church. However, it will be with all its faults
a magnificent building.</p>

<p>I ended my day (the 25th) by going to a ball at the Tuileries,
one of the great balls, and a magnificent spectacle indeed.
The long line of light gleaming through the whole length of
the palace is striking as it is approached, and the interior,
with the whole suite of apartments brilliantly illuminated,
and glittering from one end to the other with diamonds and
feathers and uniforms, and dancing in all the several rooms,
made a splendid display. The supper in the theatre was
the finest thing I ever saw of the kind; all the women sup
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
first, and afterwards the men, the tables being renewed over
and over again. There was an array of servants in gorgeous
liveries, and the apartment was lit by thousands of candles
(no lamps) and as light as day. The company amounted to
between 3,000 and 4,000, from all the great people down to
national guards, and even private soldiers. None of the
Carlists were there, as they none of them choose to go to
Court. The King retired before eleven; it was said that he
had received anonymous letters warning him of some intended
attempt on his person, and extraordinary precautions
were taken to guard against the entrance of any improper
people.</p>

<h3>January 26th, 1837</h3>

<p>Having seen all the high society the
night before, I resolved to see all the low to-night, and
went to Musard&rsquo;s ball&mdash;a most curious scene; two large
rooms in the rue St. Honoré almost thrown into one, a
numerous and excellent orchestra, a prodigious crowd of
people, most of them in costume, and all the women masked.
There was every description of costume, but that which was
the most general was the dress of a French post-boy, in
which both males and females seemed to delight. It was
well-regulated uproar and orderly confusion. When the
music struck up they began dancing all over the rooms; the
whole mass was in motion, but though with gestures the
most vehement and grotesque, and a licence almost unbounded,
the figure of the dance never seemed to be confused,
and the dancers were both expert in their capers and
perfect in their evolutions. Nothing could be more licentious
than the movements of the dancers, and they only seemed to
be restrained within limits of common decency by the cocked
hats and burnished helmets of the police and gendarmes
which towered in the midst of them. After quadrilling and
waltzing away, at a signal given they began galloping round
the room; then they rushed pellmell, couple after couple,
like Bedlamites broke loose, but not the slightest accident
occurred. I amused myself with this strange and grotesque
sight for an hour or more, and then came home.</p>

<h3>January 27th, 1837</h3>

<p>Called on Talleyrand and sat with him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RELATIONS OF FRANCE AND ENGLAND.</span>
for an hour. He talked of England in a very Conservative
strain. I called on the Duc de Broglie, Mesdames de Marescalchi
and Durazzo, dined at the Embassy, then to Madame
de Lieven&rsquo;s and Pembroke&rsquo;s concert. Not a profitable life,
but not dull, and the day glides away.</p>

<h3>February 2nd, 1837</h3>

<p>Nothing worth noticing for the last three
or four days. Dined the day before yesterday with the Duc
de Poix, and went to Hope&rsquo;s ball; his house is a sumptuous
palace in miniature, all furnished and decorated with inconceivable
luxury and <i>recherche</i>; one room hung with cachemires.
Last night to a small ball at Court. Supper in the
gallery de Diane&mdash;round tables, all the ladies supping first;
the whole thing as beautiful and magnificent as possible, and
making all our fêtes look pitiful and mean after it.</p>

<p>Our King&rsquo;s speech was here before seven o&rsquo;clock yesterday
evening, about twenty-nine hours after it was delivered; a
rapidity of transmission almost incredible. Lord Granville
had predicted to me in the morning that they would be very
angry here at no mention being made of France, and so it
was. I heard the same thing from other quarters, and he
told me that he had found himself not deceived in his expectations,
and that the King had himself complained. The
French Government had taken such pains latterly to conciliate
ours, by their speeches in the Chambers, and by
applying for votes of money to enable them to employ more
custom-house officers for the express purpose of preventing
the transmission of arms and stores to the Spanish Pretender;
in short, giving us every proof of goodwill; that Lord
Granville was desirous of having some expressions of corresponding
goodwill and civility inserted in the speech, and said
as much to Lord Palmerston; but he refused, and replied that
as they could not speak of France with praise, it was better
not to mention her at all. I have been riding with Lord
Granville the last two days, when he talked a good deal about
France and French affairs. His own position here is wonderfully
agreeable, because all the business of the two countries
is transacted by him here, and Sebastiani&rsquo;s is little more
than a nominal embassy. This has long been the case,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
having begun in Canning&rsquo;s time; then the great intimacy
which subsisted between the Duc de Broglie and Lord
Granville confirmed it during his Ministry, and the principal
cause of Talleyrand&rsquo;s hatred to Palmerston was the refusal
of the latter to alter the practice when he was in England,
and his mortification at finding the part he played in London
to be secondary to that of the British Ambassador in
Paris.</p>

<p>The Duc de Broglie seems to have been the most high-minded
and independent of all the Ministers who have been
in place, and the only one who kicked against the personal
supremacy of the King in the conduct of affairs. He looked
to constitutional analogies, and thought it incompatible with
Ministerial responsibility. The King appealed to the example
of William III., and said to Lord Granville, &lsquo;King William
presided in person at his council board, after your revolution?&rsquo;
It was Broglie&rsquo;s scruple (for it hardly ever amounted
to resistance) on this head that made the King dislike him
so much. It is certainly true that the present state of things
is an anomaly, but France is in its infancy as to constitutional
practice, and the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility, with
all its indispensable consequences, is not understood. Nothing
can exemplify this more than the recent case of a man which
was agitated in the Chambers, and passed off so easily. He
was one of the French refugees in Switzerland, and Montalivet,
Minister of the Interior, the man most in the
King&rsquo;s confidence, engaged him in his service to act as a spy
on the other refugees, but without letting Thiers (President
of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs) know that
he had done so. Accordingly Thiers demanded, through the
French Ambassador, the Duc de Montebello, that this man
(with the rest) should be expelled from Switzerland, he being
at the time the agent of Thiers&rsquo; own colleague. In the
course of the subsequent discussions this fact came out,
when Thiers declared he had been ignorant of his employment,
and Montalivet merely said that he had acted as he
deemed best for the interest of the country, and this excuse
was taken and nothing more said. Thiers took it more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.</span>
quietly than he would otherwise have done, because he had
committed himself in his correspondence with Montebello, and
it would not have suited him to have his letters published.
At that time the Duke of Orleans was gone to Vienna, and
Thiers was in all the fervour of his hopes of obtaining one
of the Archduchesses for the Prince, and he was therefore the
humble servant of Austria, and endeavouring to court her
favour in all ways, especially by truckling to her views in
the affair of the refugees.</p>

<p>I asked Madame de Lieven what was the reason that
the great Powers would not let the Duke of Orleans find a
wife, and why especially the Emperor Nicholas (who, it
was to be presumed, desired the continuance of peace and
order in France, and therefore of this dynasty) took every
opportunity of showing his contempt and aversion for the
King, being the only Sovereign who had never congratulated
him by letter on his various escapes from assassination. She
replied that it was not surprising that Sovereigns and their
families should be indisposed to send their daughters to a
country which they looked upon as always liable to a revolution,
and to marry them to a prince always in danger of
being expelled from France, and perhaps from Europe; and
that the Emperor (whom she did not excuse in this respect)
could not bring himself to write <i>Monsieur mon Frère</i> to Louis
Philippe, and for that reason would never compliment him
but through his ambassador; <i>au reste</i>, that the Duke of Orleans
would find a wife among the German princesses. It is,
however, very ridiculous that second and third-rate royalties
should give themselves all sorts of airs, and affect to hold
cheap the King of France&rsquo;s eldest son, and talk of his
alliance as a degradation. There are two Würtemberg
princesses, daughters of the Duchess of Oldenburg, who talk
in this strain; one of them is good-looking, and the Duke
of Orleans in his recent expedition in Germany had the
curiosity to travel incognito out of his way to take a look at
them. The King their father, who heard of it, complained
to Madame de Lieven of the impertinence of such conduct;
but the girls were enchanted, and with all their pretended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
aversion and contempt for the Orleans family, were in a
flutter of excited vanity at his having come to look at them,
and in despair at not having seen him themselves.</p>

<h3>London, February 7th, 1837</h3>

<p>Left Paris on Friday at five o&rsquo;clock,
and got to Boulogne at half-past one on Saturday; passed
the day with my cousin Richard, and walked all over
Boulogne, the ramparts and the pier.</p>

<h3>February 22nd, 1837</h3>

<p>An unhappy business not to be recorded
here has so completely absorbed my attention that I could
not think of politics or of anything else that is passing in
the world. The Session had opened (before I arrived) with
a reconciliation, as usual, between the Whigs and Radicals,
but with a general opinion that the Government was nevertheless
in considerable danger. In a long correspondence
which I had with Tavistock I urged that his friends ought
to give up the appropriation clause, and propose poor laws
and payment of the Catholic clergy. The first two they have
done, and the last probably they really cannot do. As I
have all along thought, it will be reserved for Peel to carry
this great measure into effect. Caring much for the measure
and nothing for men of either party, I shall rejoice to take
it from anybody&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<h3>February 25th, 1837</h3>

<p>I was interrupted while writing, and
since I began, the division of eighty in favour of the Irish Corporation
Bill appears to have settled that question, and at
the same time those of dissolution and change. At the beginning
of the Session the Tories were (as they are always
ready to be) in high spirits, and the Government people in
no small alarm. The elections had generally gone against
them, and there were various symptoms of a reaction. In
Scotland the Renfrewshire election was attributed to Peel&rsquo;s
visit and speech, and old Lauderdale wrote word that it was
the most remarkable proof of a change there which had
occurred since the Reform Bill. Nothing was talked of but
a dissolution, of Peel&rsquo;s taking office, and many people confidently
predicted that new elections would produce a Tory
majority. Besides, it was argued that the same spirit which
turned out Peel in 1835 could not be roused again, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">VIOLENT SCENE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</span>
several moderate Whigs would give him their support if he
endeavoured to go on with this Parliament. In the midst
of all these speculations this debate came on. It was exceedingly
feeble on the part of the Opposition. Stanley,
Graham, and Peel successively spoke, and none of them well;
the latter was unusually heavy. The best speeches on the
other side were Charles Buller&rsquo;s and Roebuck&rsquo;s (Radicals),
and Howick&rsquo;s. Sheil made a grand declamatory tirade,
chiefly remarkable for the scene it produced, which was unexampled
in the House, and for its credit may be hoped such
as never will occur again. There was a blackguard ferocity
in it which would have disgraced the National Convention
or the Jacobin Club. Lyndhurst was sitting under the
gallery, and Sheil, turning to him as he said it, uttered one
of his vehement sentences against the celebrated and unlucky
expression of &lsquo;aliens.&rsquo; The attack was direct, and it
was taken up by his adherents, already excited by his speech.
Then arose a din and tumultuous and vociferous cheering,
such as the walls never echoed to before; they stood up, all
turning to Lyndhurst, and they hooted and shouted at him
with every possible gesture and intonation of insult. It
lasted ten minutes, the Speaker in vain endeavouring to
moderate the clamour. All this time Lyndhurst sat totally
unmoved; he neither attempted to stir, nor changed a
muscle of his countenance. At length they divided, and
there was a majority of eighty; sixteen more than on the
same question last year.</p>

<p>The next morning (yesterday) Wharncliffe called on me,
and I found that they were prodigiously depressed at this
defeat. He said that they had suffered from many unusual
casualties, sicknesses, and deaths, and that their
people could not be made to attend. He instanced three
cases of lukewarmness and indifference. Sir G. Noel remained
in the House till twelve o&rsquo;clock, and then went to
bed; Lord John Scott went out of town in the morning
of the division, because he was engaged to dine somewhere;
and young Lefroy, who had paired with Sheil <i>until
this question</i>, set off with him to embark for England from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Dublin, and turned back from the steamboat because it
blew hard, and he said his mother would be alarmed for his
safety. Wharncliffe told me that Peel is very much disgusted
at such coolness, and that, while he is slaving body
and mind in the cause, he cannot even depend upon the
corporeal presence of his idle and luxurious followers, who
will sacrifice none of their amusements for the cause which
they pretend to think is in such danger. On the other hand,
the rash and foolish (no small proportion) are dissatisfied
with his caution, and the prudence which they call timidity;
they are always for doing something desperate. Lyndhurst
last year in the House of Lords was the man after their own
hearts, and they were quite willing to depose the Duke from
his leadership of the party, and put themselves under the
guidance of Lyndhurst. When we recollect who and what
Lyndhurst was and is, it is curious to see the aristocracy of
England adopting him for their chief; scarcely an Englishman
(for his father was an American
painter<a name="FNA_32_05" id="FNA_32_05"></a><a href="#FN_32_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>),
a lawyer of
fortune, in the sense in which, we say a soldier of fortune,
without any fixed principles, and only conspicuous for his
extraordinary capacity, he has no interest but what centres
in himself, and is utterly destitute of those associations
which naturally belong to an aristocracy. There is probably
not a man of the party who is not fully aware of Lyndhurst&rsquo;s
character, and they have already experienced the results of
his political daring in his famous attempt to interrupt the
Reform Bill by the postponement of Schedule A; and with
this knowledge and experience they follow him blindly, lead
them where he will. Wharncliffe owned to me that he saw
no alternative but the compromise, but that he did not know
whether his party would be brought to consent to it. I told
him that they could not help themselves, and must consent;
besides that, if the Tithe Bill is passed they will have got
the security for the Church which they require, and the
ground of objection to the Corporation Bill would be cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE BISHOPS IN A FERMENT.</span>
from under their feet. It is remarkable, and rather amusing
to a neutral like me, to hear what each party says of the
concessions of the other. I see in the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; this day
that &lsquo;the Lords cannot now pass the Bill if they would,
without disgracing their party in the House of Commons,&rsquo;
and Wharncliffe said that &lsquo;the Government could not give
up the appropriation clause in the Tithe Bill without covering
themselves with disgrace.&rsquo; In my opinion the disgrace is
not in making concessions which reason and expediency
demand, and which are indispensable to the peace and tranquillity
of the country, but in ever having pledged themselves
to measures for party purposes, or to accomplish
particular ends, without calculating the consequences of
such pledges, or estimating the degree of power that they
would possess of giving effect to the principles they avowed.
This applies more strongly a great deal to the Whigs about
the Tithe Bill than to the Tories about the Corporations; but
it does apply to both, and it is a national misfortune when
two great parties so commit themselves that no adjustment
of the question at issue between them is possible without
some detriment to the credit and character of both.</p>

<h3>March 18th, 1837</h3>

<p>Three weeks, and nothing written. The
dejection of the Tories at the division on the Corporation
Bill has been since relieved by that on the Church-rates,
which they consider equivalent to a victory; and so it is, for
the probability is that the Bill will not pass the House of
Commons. The debates have been good upon both these
matters. Just before the question came on, the Bishops
made a grand <i>flare-up</i> in the House of Lords. The Archbishop
of Canterbury (Howley), with as much venom as so mild a
man can muster, attacked the Bill. Melbourne replied with
some asperity, and the Bishop of London (Blomfield) retorted
fiercely upon him. The Tories lauded and the Whigs
abused the Bishops, both vehemently. I don&rsquo;t admire their
conduct, either as to temper or discretion. The Church had
better not be militant, and to see the Bench of Bishops in
direct and angry collision with the King&rsquo;s Prime Minister
is a sorry sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
The angry debate which took place was not contemplated
by the Bishops. It had been settled that the Archbishop
should make his declaration against the measure in the
name of his brethren, which he did in a speech (for him)
remarkably good, for he is a miserable speaker at all times.
Melbourne&rsquo;s severe remarks provoked the Bishop of London
(Blomfield), who had not intended to speak, and he said to
the Archbishop, &lsquo;I must answer this,&rsquo; who replied, &lsquo;Do.&rsquo;
His abrupt and animated exordium, &lsquo;And so, my Lords,&rsquo; was
very much admired.</p>

<p>This Church rate Bill, however, is a bad Bill; it gives little
satisfaction to anybody except to the Dissenters, who have no
right to require such a concession to what they absurdly call
their scruples of conscience. One of the underwhippers of
Government dropped the truth as to the real cause of such a
measure, when he said that, &lsquo;if they had proposed Althorp&rsquo;s
plan, they should have had all the Dissenters against them at
the next elections.&rsquo; The question, originally one of considerable
difficulty, is now doubly so, and its solution will not be
easy, especially by this Government; but nothing can prevent
its being settled. It is strange that no experience can open
the eyes of inveterate Tories and High Churchmen, and that
successive defeats have not demonstrated to them the futility
of their expectations of being able to resist the passing
of measures which great interests support, and which are
congenial to public opinion. There is, however, something
discreditable in the conduct of Government, and which shows
the compromising, half-cunning, hand-to-mouth way in which
they are compelled to scramble on. Upon the ballot the
&lsquo;Times&rsquo; published a list of at least twenty members of the
Government who stayed away, leaving the Tories to fight the
Radicals and make the majority, and such a measure as this
Church-rate Bill is utterly inconsistent with Lord John
Russell&rsquo;s declarations last year. This division has again
revived the question of dissolution and change of Government,
and made a great deal of speculation. If the Lords
dare throw out the Corporation Bill, the Government must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">APPROPRIATION CLAUSES ABANDONED.</span>
go out, though not else; but it is next to impossible they
should venture on this.</p>

<h3>March 31st, 1837</h3>

<p>So I thought upon the 18th of March, but
so I do not think now. In the first place, I hear from those
who are well informed that the Lords have made up their
minds to throw out this Bill. Lord John Russell has made up
his to resign if they do, and in that case Peel has made up
his to come in. It does not appear, however, that the great
body of the Whigs are at all prepared to go out. Some
doubt the Lords rejecting the Bill, others that the Tories
would take office, or that Melbourne and his friends would
so certainly resign it. Lord Spencer wrote to John Russell,
and told him that if the Lords did throw out the Bill, he
thought that (being still supported by a majority of the Commons)
he ought not to resign, but Lord John wrote him back
decisive and convincing reasons why his retention of office
under such circumstances would be impossible. The fact
is that there is a great change in the face of affairs. The
small majority on the Church rate Bill, the unpopularity of
the measure, and the discredit which attends our foreign relations
(since Evans&rsquo;s defeat in Spain more especially), have had
a material effect upon the moral efficacy of the Government.
It is now known that Government have abandoned the appropriation
clauses in the Tithe Bill, and this has grievously
offended many of their violent, thick and thin supporters,
more especially as it was the particular question on which
they turned Peel out; and the grand principle, therefore,
on which the Government was bound in honour and consistency
to stand. The Ministers none of them possess any
public confidence in their individual or official capacities;
the King detests them, the country does not care for them,
and the House of Commons supports them in a lukewarm
spirit. If they do resign there will be no repetition of the
scenes of their former expulsion and triumphant return to
power. The same enthusiasm could not be raised, nor the
same union brought about. I hear men in office talk of Peel
going on without a dissolution, and the most interested
adherents of Government (Tavistock for example) of a fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
trial, and of his having a better right to it now than he had
on the former occasion. Peel&rsquo;s undoubted fitness for office,
his vast superiority to all the other public men of the day,
will be more readily acknowledged, and I doubt very much
whether he would experience any such factious and uncompromising
opposition as would seriously obstruct the march
of his Government, particularly if its composition should be
tolerable, and his measures judicious and liberal. It is very
remarkable that when he wanted to take in Stanley and
Graham formerly, he desired them more particularly because
they would have strengthened his hands in the establishment
of liberal principles <i>against</i> the great body of his Tory supporters,
and they refused upon the pretext that they had no
security for his being liberal enough; and now, when of
course he must and will place whatever offices they please
at their disposal, so far from being of the same assistance to
him, they only bring an addition of bigotry and illiberality
which will perpetually cast difficulties and embarrassments
in his way. It is a curious matter for speculation how he
will go on with these men, how his coldness, prudence, and
reserve will suit the intemperate and often injudicious vivacity
of Stanley. With Graham there would not be so much difficulty,
and <i>his</i> principles would not be found too inflexible.
Nothing shocks his old Whig associates more than the contrast
between his present conduct and opinions, and the
extreme violence which he displayed at the period of his
accession to office in 1831; he was in fact the most ultra
Liberal of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Cabinet, and now he is little better
than a Tory.</p>

<p>The King, who is a thorough party man, will be overjoyed
at any change; he never loses an opportunity of
showing his antipathy to his confidential servants. The other
day at the reception of the Bath, when Lord Aylmer was
introduced, he made him a speech to which he gave that
sort of dramatic effect which he is so fond of doing. Aylmer
had been recalled from Canada by this Government, but when
he approached the throne, the King called out to Lord Minto
and Lord Palmerston (the only two Ministers who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S ADDRESS TO LORD AYLMER.</span>
Knights of the Bath), and made them come up, and stand
one on each side of Aylmer, that they might not lose a word
of his oration, and then he began. He told them that he
wished to take that, the most public opportunity he could
find, of telling him that he approved most entirely of his
conduct in Canada, that he had acted like a true and loyal
subject towards a set of traitors and conspirators, and behaved
as it became a British officer to do under such circumstances.
I forget the exact expressions, but it was to
this effect, to the unspeakable satisfaction of Aylmer, and to
inflict all the mortification he could upon the Ministers whom
he had lugged up to witness this ebullition.</p>

<p>Another circumstance will facilitate the change of
Ministry, which is, that the question is not argued as if it
were a struggle for authority between the Lords and the
Commons, for the notion of such a struggle would be well
calculated to excite a constitutional jealousy. The Lords,
however, pretend that their support of the Protestant interest
is not only in itself constitutional, but more in accordance
with the sentiments of the nation than the measures of the
Government are. The two parties are pretty evenly balanced,
but the strength of the Opposition lies in the Lords, and it
is altogether a question of party tactics, and not of constitutional
principle. Of all men, Peel is the last to favour any
attempt to question the virtual supremacy of the House of
Commons, and if he becomes Minister, and has a majority
(as of course he must, to stay in), the high tide of the Lords
will begin to ebb, and everything will be seen to settle down
into the usual practice. If a victory is achieved, it will not
be that of the Lords over the Commons, but of the Conservatives
over the Whigs and Radicals.</p>

<p>The fierce dispute between Sydney Smith and the Bishop
of London, which gave birth to his
pamphlet,<a name="FNA_32_06" id="FNA_32_06"></a><a href="#FN_32_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
has terminated
in an interview sought by Sydney and accorded by the
Bishop, when they are said to have discussed the matter in
dispute with temper and candour, and to have parted amicably.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
It will probably prevent the appearance of Sydney&rsquo;s
second pamphlet, which was ready. He speaks in terms of
great admiration of the capacity of the Bishop, and owned
that he had convinced him upon some of the points which
they had to discuss. I did not hear what the Bishop said of
the Prebend.</p>

defence of Deans and Chapters.]</p></div>

<p>Among the many old people who have been cut off by
this severe weather, one of the most remarkable is Mrs.
Fitzherbert, who died at Brighton at above eighty years of
age. She was not a clever woman, but of a very noble spirit,
disinterested, generous, honest, and affectionate, greatly beloved
by her friends and relations, popular in the world, and
treated with uniform distinction and respect by the Royal
Family. The late King, who was a despicable creature,
grudged her the allowance he was bound to make her, and
he was always afraid lest she should make use of some of the
documents in her possession to annoy or injure him. This
mean and selfish apprehension led him to make various
efforts to obtain possession of those the appearance of which
he most dreaded, and among others, one remarkable attempt
was made by Sir William Knighton some years ago. Although
a stranger to Mrs. Fitzherbert, he called one day at her
house, when she was ill in bed, insisted upon seeing her,
and forced his way into her bedroom. She contrived (I
forget how) to get rid of him without his getting anything
out of her, but this domiciliary visit determined her to make
a final disposition of all the papers she possessed, that in
the event of her death no advantage might be taken of
them either against her own memory or the interests of any
other person. She accordingly selected those papers which
she resolved to preserve, and which are supposed to be the
documents and correspondence relating to her marriage with
George IV., and made a packet of them which was deposited
at her banker&rsquo;s, and all other letters and papers she
condemned to the flames. For this purpose she sent for the
Duke of Wellington and Lord Albemarle, told them her
determination, and in their presence had these papers burnt;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MEETING AT APSLEY HOUSE.</span>
she assured them that everything was destroyed, and if after
her death any pretended letters or documents were produced,
they might give the most authoritative contradiction to their
authenticity.</p>

<h3>May 13th, 1836</h3>

<p>I have been six weeks without writing a
line, and though no great events have occurred, the aspect
of affairs has been continually shifting and changing. About
a month ago it was supposed the fall of the Government was
at hand, and when the crisis was over it was found that they
had really been in danger. The Duke of Wellington called
a meeting at Apsley House just before the Corporation Bill
came on in the House of Lords, and a great point was made
of the resolution of the Tory Lords being kept secret till the
last moment. The mystery excited some curiosity, but after
all it only turned out to be what everybody had long before
talked about, the postponement of the Committee. This was
done by the Duke in a very bad speech, so bad that Fitzgerald
and others were obliged to try and do away its effect
by making out that he did not mean what he said. On the
division the Government had greater numbers than usual.
It then remained to be seen what Lord John Russell would do,
and it was reported that he meant to retaliate by postponing
the Tithe Bill, but he did no such thing. He came down and
declared that they would regularly go on with all their bills,
and moreover, that while they retained the confidence of the
House of Commons they would not resign; so again it seems
likely that the compromise originally anticipated will take
place at last, and there will be no change. This declaration
of Lord John&rsquo;s is at variance with his former resolution, and
so I told Tavistock it would appear to be. He admitted that it
would, but said that John claimed for himself to judge of the
fit moment for his resignation; that whenever he was satisfied
that he had no reasonable prospect of carrying his measures,
he should retire, but not till then; and that one defeat ought
not to make him throw up the game. However, he owned that
this qualification ought to have formed part of his original
declaration, in order to obviate all misrepresentation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
During the last week the Westminster
election<a name="FNA_32_07" id="FNA_32_07"></a><a href="#FN_32_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
has
absorbed everything else. Though the Government were
by way of taking no part, all Brooks&rsquo;s moved heaven and
earth for Leader, and until the day of nomination they
were confident of his success. Bets were two to one in
his favour, and a great deal was lost and won. On the
other hand the Tories worked hard for Burdett. He appeared
on the hustings at the nomination, and was received
quite as well as his opponent, and the show of hands was in
his favour. This reduced the betting to even, but nobody
was prepared for the great majority by which Burdett won.
It was certainly a great triumph to the Conservative cause,
and a great disappointment to the violent Whigs, and still
more to the Radicals. The Government affect to make light
of it. Melbourne is probably sincere when he says he is very
glad of it, and for this reason, &lsquo;that the Radicals are very
difficult to manage as it is, and if they had carried this
election there would be no doing anything with them.&rsquo; A
great many people on both sides would not vote. I would
not, for one. I hate Leader&rsquo;s politics, and don&rsquo;t like Burdett&rsquo;s;
nobody can tell what he is, for his answers and explanations
are of a shuffling, ambiguous character, and he
disgusted me by throwing over the new Poor Law, which was
a base compliance. However, though I would not vote, I
was rather glad he came in, and somewhat like Lord Grey,
who said last night, &lsquo;he was glad at Leader&rsquo;s defeat, and
sorry for Burdett&rsquo;s success.&rsquo;</p>

and Sir Francis Burdett (Conservative). Burdett was returned by a
majority of 515. It was a chivalrous contest. Burdett had resigned his
seat voluntarily to test the feeling of his constituents, and Leader resigned a
seat for Bridgewater solely to meet Burdett in Westminster.]</p></div>

<h3>May 23rd, 1837</h3>

<p>There was great triumph among the Conservatives
at Burdett&rsquo;s success, raised to a higher pitch by
that of Broadwood at Bridgewater, which makes the whole
thing very complete, Leader having fallen between the two
stools, and now they expect to get Glasgow, if they succeed
in which there will be no bounds to their exultation. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ILLNESS OF THE KING.</span>
it is suspected that there have been difficulties and divisions
in the Cabinet. There was a meeting at Lord Grey&rsquo;s of
Ministers and Ministerial adherents, it was supposed for the
purpose of his patching up matters, but I know nothing of
what occurred. The Duke of Wellington, too, had an
audience of the King on Wednesday last, and all these things
set surmises afloat. At another time I should probably have
bestirred myself and found out what all this meant, but I
have been so occupied and absorbed with the Derby that I
could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>The King prayed that he might live till the Princess
Victoria was of age, and he was very nearly dying just as
the event arrived. He is better, but supposed to be in a
very precarious state. There has been a fresh squabble
between Windsor and Kensington about a proposed allowance
to the Princess.</p>

<h3>June 2nd, 1836</h3>

<p>The King has been desperately ill, his pulse
down at thirty; they think he will now get over it for this
time. His recovery will not have been accelerated by the
Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s answer to the City of London&rsquo;s address,
in which she went into the history of her life, and talked of
her &lsquo;friendless state&rsquo; on arriving in this country, the gist of
it being that, having been abandoned or neglected by the
Royal Family, she had thrown herself on the country.</p>

<h3>June 11th, 1836</h3>

<p>At Buckhurst last week for Ascot; went on
Monday and returned on Friday. On Tuesday the Queen
came to the course, but only stayed an hour. They had an
immense party at the Castle notwithstanding the King&rsquo;s
illness. I met Adolphus Fitzclarence at the course, who
gave me an account of the King&rsquo;s state, which was bad
enough, though not for the moment alarming; no disease,
but excessive weakness without power of rallying. He also
gave me an account of the late Kensington quarrel. The
King wrote a letter to the Princess offering her 10,000&#8467;. a
year (not out of his privy purse), which he proposed should be
at her own disposal and independent of her mother. He sent
this letter by Lord Conyngham with orders to deliver it into
the Princess&rsquo;s own hands. Conyngham accordingly went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Kensington (where Conroy received him) and asked to be
admitted to the Princess. Conroy asked by what authority.
He said by his Majesty&rsquo;s orders. Conroy went away, and
shortly after Conyngham was ushered into the presence of the
Duchess and Princess, when he said that he had waited on
her Royal Highness by the King&rsquo;s commands to present to
her a letter with which he had been charged by his Majesty.
The Duchess put out her hand to take it, when he said he
begged her Royal Highness&rsquo;s pardon, but he was expressly
commanded by the King to deliver the letter into the
Princess&rsquo;s own hands. Her mother then drew back and the
Princess took the letter, when Conyngham made his bow and
retired. Victoria wrote to the King, thanking him and
accepting his offer. He then sent to say that it was his
wish to name the person who should receive this money for
her, and he proposed to name Stephenson. Then began the
dispute. The Duchess of Kent objected to the arrangement,
and she put forth her claim, which was that she should have
6,000&#8467;. of the money and the Princess 4,000&#8467;. How the
matter had ended Adolphus did not know when I saw him.
[It never was settled.]</p>

<p>The Duchess of Northumberland had been to Windsor
and resigned her office of governess a few days before.</p>

<p>On Wednesday it was announced for the first time that
the King was alarmingly ill, on Thursday the account was no
better, and in the course of Wednesday and Thursday his
immediate dissolution appeared so probable that I concerted
with Errol that I should send to the Castle at nine o&rsquo;clock
on Thursday evening for the last report, that I might know
whether to go to London directly or not. On Wednesday
the physicians wanted to issue a bulletin, but the King
would not hear of it. He said as long as he was able to
transact public business he would not have the public
alarmed on his account; but on Friday, nevertheless, the
first bulletin was issued.</p>

<p>It is in this state of things, with the prospect of a new
reign and a dissolution, and in complete uncertainty of the
direction which affairs would take under a new influence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ILLNESS OF THE KING.</span>
when it is peculiarly desirable that moderate and healing
counsels should prevail, that Lyndhurst comes down to the
House of Lords and fires off one of his violent speeches, and
at his bidding the Irish Municipal Corporation Bill has been
again postponed. All this is very disgusting to me, and I
am at a loss to comprehend why such men as the Duke and
Peel lend themselves to such courses. In the House of
Commons John Russell took a very different line, for he
made a strong Conservative speech in answer to an omnium
gatherum Radical tirade of Roebuck&rsquo;s; just such a speech as
a Minister ought to make. Denman was persuaded to give
up his design of bringing before the House of Lords the
question of privilege, on which he is at issue with the House
of Commons, and there seems luckily a disposition to deal
with it calmly; in fact, it is no party question. The Judges
are all with their colleagues, but Peel has taken a strong
part with the House of Commons, and made a very good
speech upon it the other night.</p>

<p>I met Melbourne in the Park, who told me he thought
the King would not recover. Lord Harrowby was very much
astonished as well as annoyed at Lyndhurst&rsquo;s speech the
other night, it having been previously agreed upon that all
violence and everything offensive should be avoided. They
had resolved to postpone the Committee on the Bill as before,
but it was to have been done in the most conciliatory way,
and they were not prepared for this outbreak of Lyndhurst&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3>June 13th, 1837</h3>

<p>Bad accounts of the King yesterday. Melbourne
desired I would get everything ready <i>quietly</i> for a
Council. He has been busily occupied in examining the
precedents in order to conduct the first ceremonies properly,
and the first questions have been whether the Duchess of
Kent could come into Council with her daughter, and
whether the Duke of Cumberland (King of Hanover as he
will be) should be summoned to it.</p>

<h3>June 16th, 1837</h3>

<p>On Wednesday the King was desperately
bad, yesterday he was better, but not so as to afford any
hope, though Chambers says his recovery is not impossible.
Although the bulletins tell so little, everybody is now aware
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of his Majesty&rsquo;s state. He dictates these reports himself,
and will not allow more to be said; he continues to do
business, and his orders are taken as usual, so he is resolved
to die with harness on his back. Yesterday Lord Lansdowne
sent for me to beg in the first place that everything might
be ready, and in the next to say that they were perplexed to
know what steps, if any, they ought to take to ascertain
whether the Queen is with child, and to beg me to search
in our books if any precedent could be found at the accession
of James II. But they had forgotten that the case had been
provided for in the Regency Bill, and that in the event of
the King&rsquo;s death without children, the Queen is to be proclaimed,
but the oath of allegiance taken with a saving of
the rights of any posthumous child to King William. They
ought to have known this, but it is odd enough that there is
nobody in office who has any personal knowledge of the
usual forms at the first Council, for not one of these Ministers
was in office at the accession of William IV. My colleague,
Buller, who was present as Clerk of the Council, is dead, and
I was abroad.</p>

<p>In the morning I met Sir Robert Peel in the Park, and
talked with him about the beginning of the new reign. He
said that it was very desirable that the young Queen should
appear as much as possible emancipated from all restraint,
and exhibit a capacity for the discharge of her high functions;
that the most probable as well as the most expedient course
she could adopt, would be to rely entirely upon the advice of
Melbourne, and she might with great propriety say that she
thought it incumbent on her to follow the example which had
been set by her two uncles, her predecessors, William IV.
having retained in office the Ministers of his brother, and
George IV., although his political predilections were known to
lean another way, having also declined to dismiss the Government
of his father. Peel said that he concluded King Leopold
would be her great adviser. If Leopold is prudent, however,
he will not hurry over here at the very first moment, which
would look like an impatience to establish his influence, and
if he does, the first result will be every sort of jealousy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PRAYERS ORDERED FOR THE KING.</span>
discord between him and the Duchess of Kent. The elements
of intrigue do not seem wanting in this embryo Court.
Besides the Duchess of Kent and Leopold, and Conroy of
course,
Caradoc<a name="FNA_32_08" id="FNA_32_08"></a><a href="#FN_32_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
is suspected of a design and an expectation
to become a personage; and Lord Durham is on his way home,
and his return is regarded with no little curiosity, because
he may endeavour to play a great political part, and materially
to influence the opinions, or at least the councils, of the
Queen. What renders speculation so easy, and events uncertain,
is the absolute ignorance of everybody, without
exception, of the character, disposition, and capacity of the
Princess. She has been kept in such jealous seclusion by
her mother (never having slept out of her bedroom, nor been
alone with anybody but herself and the Baroness Lehzen),
that not one of her acquaintance, none of the attendants at
Kensington, not even the Duchess of Northumberland, her
governess, have any idea what she is, or what she promises
to be. It is therefore no difficult matter to form and utter
conjectures which nobody can contradict or gainsay but by
other conjectures equally uncertain and fallacious. The
Tories are in great consternation at the King&rsquo;s approaching
death, from the advantage which they foresee their opponents
must derive from it as far as the extension of their term of
power is concerned, and they prognosticate, according to their
custom, all sorts of dismal consequences, none of which, of
course, will come to pass. <i>Nothing</i> will happen, because, in
this country, <i>nothing</i> ever does. The Whigs, to do them
justice, behave with great decency; whatever they may really
feel, they express a very proper concern, and I have no doubt
Melbourne really feels the concern he expresses. The public
in general don&rsquo;t seem to care much, and only wonder what
will happen.</p>

<h3>June 17th, 1837</h3>

<p>Yesterday the King was better, so as to promise
a prolongation of his existence, though not his recovery.
An intimation came from Windsor, that it was desired prayers
should be offered up in the Churches for him; so the Privy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Council assembled to order this, but on assembling the
Bishop of London objected to the form which had been used
upon the last and other occasions (an order made by the
Lords to the Archbishop of Canterbury to prepare a form of
prayer), asserting that <i>the Lords</i> had no power to make such
an order, and it was even doubted by lawyers whether the
King himself had power to order alterations in the Liturgy,
or the use of the particular prayers; and admitting that he
had, it was in virtue of his prerogative, and as Head of the
Church, but that <i>the Lords of the Council</i> had no power whatever
of the kind. They admitted that he was correct in this
view of the case, and consequently, instead of an order to the
Archbishop, his Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure that prayers should be
offered up was conveyed to the Council, and a communication
to that effect was directed to be made to the Archbishop.
The King&rsquo;s pleasure being thus conveyed, it is his duty to
obey, and the Bishops have power to direct their clergy to
pray for the King. The Bishop of London would have preferred
that a prayer for his recovery as for a sick person, but
mentioning him by name, should have been adopted, but the
Archbishop was prepared with his form of prayer, and it was
directed to be used.</p>

<h3>June 18th, 1837</h3>

<p>The King lingers on; yesterday he sent for
the Archbishop of Canterbury to administer the Sacrament
to him.</p>

<p>An attack (but a feeble one) was made upon Palmerston
the other night, about Sir Charles Vaughan&rsquo;s appointment to
relieve Lord Ponsonby at Constantinople, to which he made, as
usual, a feeble and inefficient answer, but the real story did not
come out. The whole history of Lord Ponsonby is a remarkable
example of what a man in favour or with powerful protection
may do with impunity, and it is the more striking
because Palmerston is the most imperious of official despots,
and yet has invariably truckled to Lord Grey&rsquo;s brother-in-law.
When Ponsonby was appointed Ambassador at Constantinople,
the affairs of the East were in a most critical state, notwithstanding
which nothing would induce him to repair to his
post, and he loitered away several months at Naples, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PONSONBY AT CONSTANTINOPLE.</span>
Russia was maturing her designs upon Turkey, and when
the presence of an English Ambassador was of vital importance.
This was overlooked, because to Lord Grey&rsquo;s
brother-in-law everything was permitted. The appointment
of Mr. Urquhart as Secretary of the Embassy at Constantinople
greatly displeased Lord Ponsonby, who resolved to
hold no communication with him, and accordingly the
Chancellerie at Constantinople has presented the amusing
spectacle of an Ambassador and Secretary of Embassy who
do not speak to each other, and the latter of whom has had
no functions whatever to discharge. A short time ago Lord
Ponsonby applied for leave of absence, which was given to
him, and the Government here hoped that when he came
home he would not think of returning, and secretly resolved
that if they could help it he should not. But as Mr. Urquhart
had been placed in this strange position, and besides, since
his appointment, they had found reason to doubt whether
he was altogether fit for such a trust, it was impossible
to leave him at Constantinople as <i>chargé d&rsquo;affaires</i>
during his chief&rsquo;s absence, so they got Sir Charles Vaughan
to go out on what was called a special mission, though there
was nothing more in it than to meet this difficulty. Sir
Charles was directed to proceed to Malta, and from thence to
send a steamer to Constantinople, which was to announce
his arrival and bring back Lord Ponsonby. Sir Charles,
accordingly, sent his Secretary of Embassy to announce him,
who, when he arrived off Constantinople, was met by an
absolute prohibition from Ponsonby to land at all, and a flat
refusal on his part to stir. The Secretary had nothing to
do but to return to his principal and report his reception,
and he in his turn had nothing to do but report his ridiculous
position to his employers at home, and await their orders.
The result has been that Sir Charles is ordered home, and
Lord Ponsonby remains, so that Palmerston has knocked
under. Ponsonby has carried his point, and Vaughan has
had a <i>giro</i> to Malta and back, for which the public has to pay.</p>

<h3>June 19th, 1837</h3>

<p>Yesterday the King was sinking fast; the
Sacrament was administered to him by the Archbishop of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
Canterbury. He said, &lsquo;This is the 18th of June; I should
like to live to see the sun of Waterloo set.&rsquo; Last night I
met the Duke, and dined at the Duchess of Cannizzaro&rsquo;s, who
after dinner crowned him with a crown of laurel (in joke of
course), when they all stood up and drank his health, and
at night they sang a hymn in honour of the day. He asked
me whether Melbourne had had any communication with the
Princess Victoria. I said I did not know, but thought not.
He said, &lsquo;He ought. I was in constant communication with
the present King for a month before George IV. died.
George IV. was for a month quite as bad as this King, and
I sent the Duke of Clarence the bulletins every day, and
besides wrote to him the private accounts I received, and
what is very odd, I had a quarrel with him in the course of
this. He constantly wrote to me, and in one of his letters
he told me he meant to make me his Minister. I felt this
was a very awkward subject for me to enter upon, and that
I could not, being the Minister of the King, with any propriety
treat with his successor, so I resolved to take no notice
whatever of this part of his letter, and I did not. He was
very indignant at this, and complained to his friends (to Lord
Cassilis, for instance) that I had behaved very rudely to him.
When I met him&mdash;for I met him constantly at Windsor,
and in the King&rsquo;s room&mdash;he was very cold in his manner, but
I took no notice, and went on as before.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>June 21st, 1837</h3>

<p>The King died at twenty minutes after two
yesterday morning, and the young Queen met the Council
at Kensington Palace at eleven. Never was anything like
the first impression she produced, or the chorus of praise
and admiration which is raised about her manner and behaviour,
and certainly not without justice. It was very extraordinary,
and something far beyond what was looked for.
Her extreme youth and inexperience, and the ignorance of
the world concerning her, naturally excited intense curiosity
to see how she would act on this trying occasion, and there
was a considerable assemblage at the Palace, notwithstanding
the short notice which was given. The first thing to be
done was to teach her her lesson, which for this purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FIRST COUNCIL OF QUEEN VICTORIA.</span>
Melbourne had himself to learn. I gave him the Council
papers, and explained all that was to be done, and he went
and explained all this to her. He asked her if she would
enter the room accompanied by the Great Officers of State,
but she said she would come in alone. When the Lords
were assembled the Lord President informed them of the
King&rsquo;s death, and suggested, as they were so numerous, that
a few of them should repair to the presence of the Queen
and inform her of the event, and that their Lordships were
assembled in consequence; and accordingly the two Royal
Dukes, the two Archbishops, the Chancellor, and Melbourne
went with him. The Queen received them in the adjoining
room alone. As soon as they had returned the proclamation
was read and the usual order passed, when the doors were
thrown open and the Queen entered, accompanied by her
two uncles, who advanced to meet her. She bowed to the
Lords, took her seat, and then read her speech in a clear,
distinct, and audible voice, and without any appearance of
fear or embarrassment. She was quite plainly dressed, and
in mourning. After she had read her speech and taken and
signed the oath for the security of the Church of Scotland,
the Privy Councillors were sworn, the two Royal
Dukes<a name="FNA_32_09" id="FNA_32_09"></a><a href="#FN_32_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
first, by themselves; and as these two old men, her uncles,
knelt before her, swearing allegiance and kissing her hand,
I saw her blush up to the eyes, as if she felt the contrast
between their civil and their natural relations, and this was
the only sign of emotion which she evinced. Her manner to
them was very graceful and engaging; she kissed them both,
and rose from her chair and moved towards the Duke of
Sussex, who was farthest from her and too infirm to reach
her. She seemed rather bewildered at the multitude of men
who were sworn, and who came one after another to kiss her
hand, but she did not speak to anybody, nor did she make
the slightest difference in her manner, or show any in her
countenance, to any individual of any rank, station, or party.
I particularly watched her when Melbourne and the Ministers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and the Duke of Wellington and Peel approached her. She
went through the whole ceremony, occasionally looking at
Melbourne for instruction when she had any doubt what to
do, which hardly ever occurred, and with perfect calmness
and self-possession, but at the same time with a graceful
modesty and propriety particularly interesting and ingratiating.
When the business was done she retired as she
had entered, and I could see that nobody was in the adjoining
room. Lord Lansdowne insisted upon being declared
President of the Council (and I was obliged to write
a declaration for him to read to that effect), though it was
not usual. The speech was admired, except by Brougham,
who appeared in a considerable state of excitement. He
said to Peel (whom he was standing near, and with whom
he is not in the habit of communicating), &lsquo;<i>A</i>melioration, that
is not English; you might perhaps say <i>me</i>lioration, but improvement
is the proper word.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Peel, &lsquo;I see no
harm in the word; it is generally used.&rsquo; &lsquo;You object,&rsquo; said
Brougham, &lsquo;to the sentiment, I object to the grammar.&rsquo;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Peel, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t object to the sentiment.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
then, she pledges herself to the policy of <i>our</i> Government,&rsquo;
said Brougham. Peel told me this, which passed in the room
and near to the Queen. He likewise said how amazed he was
at her manner and behaviour, at her apparent deep sense of
her situation, her modesty, and at the same time her firmness.
She appeared, in fact, to be awed, but not daunted, and afterwards
the Duke of Wellington told me the same thing, and
added that if she had been his own daughter he could not
have desired to see her perform her part better. It was
settled that she was to hold a Council at St. James&rsquo;s this
day, and be proclaimed there at ten o&rsquo;clock, and she expressed
a wish to see Lord Albemarle, who went to her and
told her he was come to take her orders. She said, &lsquo;I have
no orders to give; you know all this so much better than I
do, that I leave it all to you. I am to be at St. James&rsquo;s at
ten to-morrow, and must beg you to find me a conveyance
proper for the occasion.&rsquo; Accordingly, he went and fetched
her in state with a great escort. The Duchess of Kent was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">QUEEN VICTORIA PROCLAIMED.</span>
in the carriage with her, but I was surprised to hear so little
shouting, and to see so few hats off as she went by. I rode
down the Park, and saw her appear at the window when she
was proclaimed. The Duchess of Kent was there, but not
prominent; the Queen was surrounded by her Ministers,
and curtsied repeatedly to the people, who did not, however,
hurrah till Lord Lansdowne gave them the signal from the
window. At twelve she held a Council, at which she presided
with as much ease as if she had been doing nothing
else all her life, and though Lord Lansdowne and my colleague
had contrived between them to make some confusion
with the Council papers, she was not put out by it. She
looked very well, and though so small in stature, and without
much pretension to beauty, the gracefulness of her manner
and the good expression of her countenance give her on the
whole a very agreeable appearance, and with her youth
inspire an excessive interest in all who approach her, and
which I can&rsquo;t help feeling myself. After the Council she
received the Archbishops and Bishops, and after them the
Judges. They all kissed her hand, but she said nothing to
any of them, very different in this from her predecessor, who
used to harangue them all, and had a speech ready for
everybody.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_32_09" id="FN_32_09"></a><a href="#FNA_32_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
The Dukes of Cumberland and Sussex. The Duke of Cambridge was
in Hanover.</p></div>

<p>Conyngham, when he came to her with the intelligence
of the King&rsquo;s death, brought a request from the Queen
Dowager that she might be permitted to remain at Windsor
till after the funeral, and she has written her a letter couched
in the kindest terms, begging her to consult nothing but her
own health and convenience, and to remain at Windsor just
as long as she pleases. In short, she appears to act with
every sort of good taste and good feeling, as well as good
sense, and as far as it has gone nothing can be more favourable
than the impression she has made, and nothing can
promise better than her manner and conduct do, though it
would be rash to count too confidently upon her judgment
and discretion in more weighty matters. No contrast can
be greater than that between the personal demeanour of the
present and the late sovereigns at their respective accessions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
William IV. was a man who, coming to the throne at the
mature age of sixty-five, was so excited by the exaltation, that
he nearly went mad, and distinguished himself by a thousand
extravagances of language and conduct, to the alarm or amusement
of all who witnessed his strange freaks; and though he
was shortly afterwards sobered down into more becoming
habits, he always continued to be something of a blackguard
and something more of a buffoon. It is but fair to his
memory at the same time to say that he was a good-natured,
kind-hearted, and well-meaning man, and he always acted an
honourable and straightforward, if not always a sound and
discreet, part. The two principal Ministers of his reign, the
Duke of Wellington and Lord Grey (though the former was
only his Minister for a few months), have both spoken of
him to me with strong expressions of personal regard and
esteem. The young Queen, who might well be either
dazzled or confounded with the grandeur and novelty of her
situation, seems neither the one nor the other, and behaves
with a decorum and propriety beyond her years, and with all
the sedateness and dignity the want of which was so conspicuous
in her uncle.</p>
